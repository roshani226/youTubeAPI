bedrock have addons
legacy console edition
bedrock also doesnt have the pvp difficulties that java does imo
i play bedrock in mobile pocket edition i understand 7 months ago that pocket and bedrock are same
we can get any mod or any skin we want too personally ill never ever buy minecoins
bedrock has a crap ton of addons that shouldve been mentioned
yea i agree java is 100 better because i got java and i realised i can make a skin with skinseed instead of paying minecoins
i think your right becoz there is so many mods and texture packs you can play with in java but in bedrock its super limited
will know one talk about how camman pointed a fallen birch tree 
you can still have every texture pack and skin with no minecoins
stupid minecoins in minecraft bedrock you habe to pay 10 dollars for a skin
damn it i dont have computer and pc
pocket edition
weird guy literally lists every reason why bedrock is better than said java 
wait yall cant stack cakes
bedrock is becoming java
imo javas command system is what really makes it more playable
java is way much better
"who gets minecoins
when you have youtube"
you do know you can get bedrock content outside of the marketplace right
pocket edition be like im still here you know what you could get mods for free on me but people forget people always forget
i like them both but i think minecoins are stupid thats why i play mods on java not bedrock
java also has banner on shield
"team java
"
well i play both of versions and i know that you can download maps mods texture packs etc
mcdelp mobile mod apps am i a joke to you
u can download free texture packs and stuff tho
lemme get my app for bedrock called addons
honestly though not everyone plays mods so for vanilla i believe that bedrock is better
ya know when u buy java u get bedrock free and also in reverse
legacy
minecoina are just for customization
bedrock has hd skins
ok so about the fact of costomization there are websites that you can import a world template or mod into your bedrock device
i have bedrock because my sisters friends have bedrock so she can play with her friends
as a bedrock player i can confirm it sucks a lot
bedrock
java is better for single players like me while bedrock is better for playing with friends
wait what pocket ppl in bedrock has an app for modsplaces and theres a app for servers
i just got a pc
all minecraft skins are available for both editions
yehsh
i hate java edition its the worst version of minecraft bedrock is better
i like bedrock
you can also get texture packs maps and skins all for free in bedrock its just overlooked by many because of the mineshop
education edition
bedrock is laggy
lets goo java is better
sodium can make java run almost as well or better than bedrock
i use java
because people might pick bedrock edition since is kinda cheaper but java edition is more expensive maybe like 89 or 30 or idk it depends
you can also download many many different free mods
dont know why they cant just make them the same best of both worlds smh
last face is lie my bedrock is lagging even if i have low rd and fast graphics but in java i got high render distance and it isnt lagging
dude i play bedrock and i have a custom skin look up an tutorial or smthn
bedrock sucks  java is best
you can still kind of do hardcore in bedrock hard mode delete the world when you die
i have java
instructions unclear for bedrock  i have no friends
legacy
bedrock
console x eddition is best
wait you java guys dont have dyed cauldrons you dont have minecoins
exactly bedrock is better because java is poop
there is no need to show java in diamonds and bedrock in bedrock just use grass for java or ill unsub to u
wait you dont need minecoins
random fact i live in java island it exists
"camman  more depth to redstone 
redstone block activating piston thin air "
i agree but just correcting something you can have any skin for free in bedrock
im not mad its just the correct answer
i will perfer that bedrock is better
i guess java to be honest and im a bedrock player
my ipad could download a skin from the internet for free sooo yea
bro pissed off the bedrock modding community
"mods in java exclusive
literally mcpedl in the corner "
i got minecraft to run on a pc with pentium 4 and only bedrock will work java just isnt good for people with integrated graphics
legacy console players chuckling
bed rock is better
legacy wins java and bedrock
as a bedrock player i hate bedrock only reason i dont play java is because i dont have the ability to run it at more than five fps
yesss java wins
java is better easily bedrock players cry about it
even though i play on bedrock i say that java is better lol 
as a person who mainly plays on bedrock but has played java i can say java is better
my ipad can barely handle roblox without lagging
whoever decided the minecraft marketplace was a good idea needs to be fired
you can get a skin in bedrock too with no minecoins
mobile players we have free mods too
my question is does both versions have all the same biomes
i mean bedrock have behavior packs that adds stuff like a mod
real ones enjoy legacy console edition
bro forgets the rtx 4k high quality ultra hd made for only strong computers shaders
im a bedrock bro
i am a bedrock player you can have addons in bedrock
as a bedrock player i download addons for free
no one talks about the lack of multiplayer that java has  you ether have single player or servers
bro bedrock doesnt need minecoins to have texture packs skins etc
"minecoins
mcpedl left the chat"
in bedrock edition you cant use door under water
i agree with you
"vote for bedrock
"
microsoft kinda ruined bedrock edition ngl
i have fallen trees on nintendo minecraft
i like b
you can mod bedrock white mcaddon files
i only like bedrock best because baby squids and dolphins exist
like ive always said about this bedrock is better for classic minecraft no mods where java is better with mods and server mini games
how did you gat java minecraft
bro forgot bedrock doesnt have the combat update 
and sweeping edge
and mojang remove the support of shader does they gonna add it again but with more features not sure
"im a bedrock player and i want the console edition 
even tho it hasnt gotten many updates lmfao"
wait is fire aspect not in java i wouldnt know i dont play java
java abuse glitchs way more
bruhhhhhhhhhh
people say that java players hate bedrock bros
but what about legacy edition
i think that sometimes trying to get texture packs shaders mods maps in java sometimes u get viruses i choose bedrock
as a bedrock player i wish i had java
do i have java or bedrock
bedrock
you can still have every skin in bedrock scamman18
finally someone who can appreciate both versions
धनयवद
you can get loooooooads of free skins and mods
vanilla and pocket  why do they have to be the best editions
bedrock has blinking skins
i play bedrock because my 2017 potato laptop cant run minecraft so i have to use my xbox but java is still better
"the only 2 things i want for minecraft bedrock is 1 hardcore mode
and 2 being able to customize your skin however you want"
man idk why we cant have them mods and stuf
aka have both or have both 
it would be nice if there is hardcore on bedrock version
java have magic but bedrock have better logic 
minecraft is minecraft so dont bully bedrock or java
agreed
u dont need minecoins but i do think java is better
maybe bedrock edition is cool i guess what even java edition i dont know where to get it from but i dont want hardcore mode
bruh i thought i could use bonemeal on sugar cane since i transitioned from bedrock to java 
i enjoy both but i enjoy java more
"java takes the big lead
but bedrock literally has better lead which can leash the boat"
at least we can agree that pocket and education are both horrible
i am a bedrock player and i fg hate it
i like java more because of shaders texture packs the menu ui elements and the combat update plus there are lots of fun modpacks
i like this video most java players refuse to even try bedrock and camman at least sees the good for both that is why he is king stay true bro 
only reason i play bedrock for now is i dont have java money 
"java is better than bedrock
bedrock is so easy and not enjoyable"
i play on java but i do have bedrock installed on my computer too so i get the best of both worlds
java player will choose java and bedrock player will choose bedrock
bedrock bedrock bedrock bedrock bedrock bedrock bedrock bedrock bedrock bedrock bedrock bedrock bedrock bedrock is better
i like bedrock better
bedrock in hard mode is harder than in java hard mode but hardcore gives 1 life so
"i play on bedrock
but i will say that both are good at their places"
bedrock is like the popular kid in school while java is the internet celebrity
so thats why i didnt see hardcore in my version
finally no war
"java modded
bedrock vanilla"
for someone who plays on bedrock i never realized how many benefits we have against java also we load chunks faster
bedrock sucks
minecraft is minecraft
bedrock is better since i play on it i dont know what java is like
"the bedrock is going up today mojang added crawls and sneak in 15 block gap
but only available
while turning on the experience"
bruh i have bboth versions and idc about diffrences
bruh bedrock has mods free skins and much more and its much easier to mod
id pick legacy console edition any day over bedrock
people who say pocket edition
no minecoins
for me i like java pvp but i dont have computer or laptop_
bedrock better
yess java but java is free xd bedrock is not im hate bedrock
as a bedrock player i am pissed that they have free mods
bro all the skins in java working on bedrock
what happened to minecraft pocket edition 
as a creative bedrock player there is some new items in minecraft that i would enjoy
so basically like bedrock is ios and java is android
java is better than bedrock
make a multiple hour long video of all your shorts
with bedrock you can still get hundreds of mods without minecoins
next up education vs console j
great points but i cant play java due to not having a pc
pocket edition solos
bedrock better bro face it
its like android vs iphone
im a bedrock player and even i know java is better
nah legacy edition is the best one
please do not tell him about downloading bedrock addons from internet
bedrock is better
"more fun java
best performance bedrock

no debate"
me too i love java
bedrock
hardcore is in bed rock you just have to have realms plus
java is just better because it can actually run stuff like big farms unlike bedrock
you cant do the underwater sand tnt trick on bedrock 
miiiiinecoins made me laugh lol
bedrock is beyond belief
yeahill be honestjava is the free premium
vote to add java to switch
java isnt available on switch
in bedrock u can use any skin or texture pack for free on mobile or your gaming pc
"the option éducation édition in minecraft bedrock 
where i am  near your home and i am more near every second"
java really doesnt have fallen trees it seems like such a normal simple thing
have you ever heard of addons
i thought he was just gonna fully hate on bedrock but apparently not
bedrock just made the console unplayable for me personally
and also crouching under 15 blocks
bedrock plus i grew up playing bedrock so yeah
ive played bedrock and just got java java is so much better
java and unbreakable rock without creative is good
i will always play java over bedrock bedrock charges kids too much money for garbage marketplace content java is worth it in the long term
bedrock sucks java is better
building mechanics are much better in java as well
bro trust me i played minecraft so long on a 150  computer
you can get custom skins of somewhere else on bedrock
actually bedrock edition theres some apps and other stuff to get free skins that work and worlds and texture packs
bedrock is better
minecraft is minecraft
i wish i could play java but im on mobile
as a technical bedrock player i know that you can have custom skins and texture packs on bedrock
omg ty im playing on my ps4
one thing no one ever points out is how insanely shy automatic farms are in bedrock and how most dont even work
i will say lunar client just so good
i already got into a war with a dude over androids andi phones so im too tired to argue
"not to mention java has tnt duping and bedrock doesnt 

i am a bedrock player and even i think java is better"
"playing alone java

playing with friends bedrock"
bedrock also allows hd skins 
mcpedl left the chat
at the end of they day theyre both still minecraft which isnt the worlds best selling game for no reason
mcpedl whats happeningim disappearingnoooo
camman forgetting that minecoins are not needed to get any of the things mentioned
bedrock best
not gonna lie  even if im a bedrock player  java is good  but we can get mods  skin  worlds for free tho 
fun fact mcpe and bedrock is the same mcpe is just bedrock but in mobile
java is better if you want to modify the game bedrock is better for playing the game without mods
yk that all the java packs can be imported for free and bedrock too right
"bedrock has three d models
which java servers dont have"
bedrock has 3
em i dont use minevoins i go onto mcpdl and get stuff
lets make it jarock 
gets a free skin
bedrock also has glitchy shields
i would pay mojang all of my pocketmoney to give bedrock better redstone i used to be a master at it but now none of the cool stuff works
java is way smoother idk how to explain it but bedrock is just kinda clunky
canman18 you dont need to use moin coins because curse forage works on bedrock to
bro we get it you hate bedrock
there are addons for bedrock online for free and they are evolving
i have both and life has never been better
mojang proceeds to remove every cool bedrock exclusive
pocket edition has both java and bedrock features
im ok with both java for more exploring and bedrock for just normal minecraft
the reason why theres dyable cauldrons in bedrock it because you cant dye leather armor with a crafting table
"java is da best 
edited part one thing tho delete birch"
bedrock is better it has its own block in minecraft and real life
you guys cant light tnt with fire aspect i genuinely didnt know that
well theres actually an app that can be used to install certain maps mobs etc into the game for bedrock
i also got a new computer
im gonna be using java edition now because its the best
"get mods with no minecoins
mcpedl has left the chat"
it was really sad when minecraft removed adventure from bedrock
pls talk trash about pocket
the one i play on
i just play both 
ik doe gewoon mijn wifi uit en dan het laden en dan het weer aan
legacy console edition is better
im going with java all the way personally
dude you can have any skin on bedrock to
noone uses minecoins
why no one covers cybersecuritywhy why why

kkkkkkkkkk nice
"i prefer 
void main 
      systemoutprintlnhi mom
"
take that phyton 
actually java even never left the scene it was always here
i just started learning java and saw this are you trying to discourage me with ai and java comeback damn
kotlin thank you i rest my case
java sucks  dvd menus in dvd players suck  tremendous lag
ngl even tho java is improving u could just ctrlaltshiftk and migrate to kotlin automatically on intellij makes everything nicer imo
just drop it man
i try kotlin
i used to love java when i started programming then i learned c and never went back
"i hated java before using spring and maven
yeah i still hate java but its like an annoying dude who comes around with cool friends"
nice video maybe you could do one on graalvm one day i think it is a really interesting concept which not everyone is aware of
why do they always have websites that look like ads 
you know the world is ending when java updates their site
i dont want to write java professionally ever please for the love of god let it slowly die
126 java 8 i and the rest of the dev team wish we had java 8 were stuck with java 6 6
my workplace has been using java 5 to this day and is updating to java 8 god please save my tormented soul
why bother with java when kotlin is like the ultimate future java on steroids that lives right now
c will always be the 
bro java trying ti improve their website is like minecrafy adding terracota truly the end of an era
as a language java is sooooooooooooooo behind kotlin
c has main with string args and nobody makes fun of it java follows strong engineering principles thats why self made hackers dont like it
java will be back together with crocs and lindsay lohan
325 only java is true
lets remove braces and semicolons also use identation remove for loops 
i have every confidence that oracle will keep you busy for some time its their super power
unpopular opinion java code is prettier to look at than python
will this bring back all the 2000s java games 
i am waiting for 4 billion devices run java
lmao that new string interpolation still sucks these are good changes though
315 ofcourse i cannot get the joke 
i hit the like button just because there isnt a haha one 
allow me introduce the   groovy programming language
this man thinks java is making comeback java always been here all time its just some javascript programmers finding what java can do
i feel attacked 
just so you know the code examples in robert martins book clean code  are all in java
thanks we have kotlin for several years already and all of that is basically normal daily use thing for me
as a java developer i dont know what im currently doing with my life and at what point do i stand
"333 
that looks somewhat concerning"
this was hilarious  string are just string 
ehh screw java
i choose java over python is that right move in 2023
"public static void mainstring args

systemoutprintlnthis code is enough to make a cpp programmer to hate java 
"
0100 sideeyes the code is this basic
korea uses a lot of java for web backend development how is java evaluated in other countries i want to know the specific reason oh i hate java
126 in all seriousness i use java 7
hard fuckin pass javascript needs to die
void main seriously it took them soo long just to copy cpp
ok but which language to learn to be interesting well paid and illegal
i prefer java over javascript mostly since javascript is unsafe and unreliable
"why should we hire you
i willingly made myself learn java"
wooo java ftw
"this dude codes in js and has the nerves to call java syntax ugly 
i cant even rn"
"great sense of humor i laughed a lot
java is still my favorite programming language"
java is good you cannot deny it
i need that boilerplate to put food on my family 
please for the love of god can they just add reified generics
java programmers making fun of you as well
well im glad i started to learn java then but the things i need java for havent updated in half a decade so 
i wanna see a return to pure c
java tooling backward compatibility and ecosystem in wholeall these make java a fantastic language to learn
i started learning programming with java xml and android not gonna lie i loved it
lmao i know a team in my company stil uses java 8
mfw when we just upgraded to java 11 from java 8 3 weeks ago 
pretty much half the jobs i see for programmers online where i live are java full stack
i love c
what people are forgetting is that the biggest pain point like boiler plate code can now be managed with copilot and ai assistant code tools
aye the old you would get it encapsulation with private variables joke good one sir
java is so hard
wait the java website redesign bit is actually hilarious they went through the effort of redesigning so that it looks like a 2011 website
c doesnt have classes man
instant subscribe
i am forced to use java for school
im just waiting for java to get a more efficient garbage collector
java is a clown language
i am a java developer and i have three words to say what the fuck
wow this is good news
humour is on point but i only understand half of the things you say which makes it funnier
hw do you make your machine run4x faster  you uninstall java
106 that aint no perfect language
u just fired java

incredibly common java w
if they take care of null pointer exception ill use java instead of kotlin
i like java
make a video where you place languages in the triangle well paid  interesting and legal
323 is that ugly offbyone error in python and c meant to be a joke that i failed to get probably
as someone who was forced to learn java for uni the memes hit hard into my soul
cant beat jdsl
people who think java is making a big comeback just clearly dont pay attention to c 
sitting in a coffee shop laughing out loud at this video
ive been using all of the features mentioned in this video in my work for at least 18 months in c
c is still the best language no matter what you say i mean c c is trash
x69  y420 xdddddddddddd
jebać jave
0315 whats the joke
323 some object in java are doers 
hahaha haha 026
i wouldnt get it because its private 
missed the opportunity to put 21 meme kid in thumbnail
c incredibly underrated
elon muck just buy java and eliminate thoughts
java is just disgusting i dont believe it could ever make a comeback
3 billios devices using java since when people were still building the pyramids
i recommend clojure
"so java 21 is changing its syntax to look more like js and c to appeal to beginners or something

stop it get some help"
do businesses not upgrade their language because they will have to do a lot of work to upgrade and change stuff 
"everyone has moved to golang
too late"
python all the way
hi fireship i am happy subscriber and i have a doubt  will java have a rebirth again  
front ends cant make fun of back ends sorry dude get better
please no 
finally java invented kotlin
c added shorter main method how many years ago its always way ahead of java
im gonna miss typing psvm and feeling like a hackermans tt
145 you can do string interpolation with the stringsubstitutor apache class for older versions of java
052 dude im dying 
im forced to learn java to get a job so good news b ascii thumbs up
java is great unironically
i learned java and also why netflix uses scala instead as a byproduct
he just made java exciting and terrifying on one video
314 how are you instantiating an object from an abstract class there
jvm good java bad
java be like to other oop langauges you have made fun of me now its my turn to make your life miserable
316 i dont get it thats a normal line of code in java
damn they removed public static void mainstring args that was my favorite piece of code
bro your poll got 26 to vote for js and 30 for python we can safely disregard those people as 
me who is still on java 16 
still dog doodoo
python programmers lol
java was the sole language that taught me oop
i dont know jack about programming but im watching these videos anyway
this video made me quit rust and starting to learn java
all the existing standard lunguages are much too old and too complex   we need a modern easy user friendly language 
well since a lot of users voted js best language of all time  i dont take it too serious d
java 21 my company still run java 6
god i hate java
youve just motivated me to download java and take a look
oh hell yeah im that student whos forced to learn java when i studied python for two months in preparation for my first year
although everything is fine java still performs slower when compared to crossplatform programming languages such as go dart and rust
can we just use kotlin scala or clojure on the jvm instead please you can only polish this turd so much
you know what strip print just hello world it will show on your screen  like html
maybe its a western thing but java is loved in india c and java are mostly used by students according to my time at college
downvote because javascript logo in thumbnail of video about java
"i am sad
not because python sucks
because no more java memes"
"it was supposed to be declaration of stopping making fun of java
my man continues make of fun of it"
i would never willingly pick java for anything new because i dont want to support the company behind it period
masterpiece
i wonder if java minecraft would get better
i cant think of this i need it make fun of
i really love this channel
first of all java is not mounting a comeback haha java never died
damn even with all these improvements this is still hurlworthy compared to kotlin
106 bro just make print on python lol
lol nice comeback now java is c from 2015 xd
i dont think java will ever come back at least in the american market the new generation despises it lmao
just keep hating on java but spring is still a god tier framework
so just copying c
oh no soon well run out of reasons to make fun of java
why do java developers wear glasses because they cant c 3
javascript is as its name suggests a scripting language not a programming language
i would argue boilerplate is important for people who have a need to understand proper picture how things work
the circle is complete first c copied java now java copy c
java has the potencial to be typescript
w vid as usual
java 1
now all that java i learnt at 11 years old messing around with runescape private servers will come in handy again
java is what you make of it keep it simple stupid
java 8 still going strong in my org lol i doubt that will change even in the next 5 years 
im very worried because i laughed a lot during this video maybe im this kind of weird developers and idk yet
to get a job make react using  tailwind css after getting one job you can learn java while  having that job
congratulations java is now kotlin
the best feature of java 21 is virtual thread but not void main is it really hard just remember psvm
so what is well paid and interesting to code asking for a friend
i literally saw java being python at 105 
minecraft anyone
kotlin  java  100
java is still a joke
noooooo muh public static void mainstringargs
"maybe you can make a short explaining the java naming convention
not sure how from java 8 we got java 14 and now java 21 "
hating on java seems to me like trying to sit well with the cool kids theres no real reason you just need a victim
yes officer thats him he updated his java
im worried about not being able to put my family on a boilerplate in the future
mfw a meme is nothing more than a wrapper around a joke
this video was fun to watch xd
a lot of common things from dart or dart from java 
after 20 years of java i finally succeeded in moving to python four years ago ill never go back
how do you get a java dev to drool out of both sides of their mouth make sure theyre sitting upright
java a comeback   spare me
whats interesting and well paid langauge but not legal
i work with enterprise java and i can swear that for them boilerplate is a feature
"java 
import static javalangsystemout
outprintlnwhy do i still have to write out

c 
using static systemconsole
writelineoh yeah
"
this video is too long and too slow
yeah no
039 some might have missed that george w bush jnr joke  but i see you fireship  i see you
as long as java cant reduce its memory footprint by half it wont compete with newer languages
finally at this rate well have a usable language when java 31
null pointer exception
a rookie is focusing on the language and not the platform again mentions kotlin scala fails to mention they run on jvm
i didnt get the wouldnt get it meme help
not a big fan of these changes ngl
java well paid and legal yep does the trick kids 
id rather go for java than python
"fireship and actually why do we even need a main function in the first place
me stop"
man i love java
man i like every language but i really enjoy working with java hahah never understand the hate with the structure i guess im a strange guy 
i prefer kotlin myself but java is perfectly okay the jvm fire though personally i cant abide weakly typed languages 
314 its all a joke
minecraft only updated to java 17 like what was that year and a half ago when 117 came out almost 2 years ago actually
the joker meme is awesome really
this whole video is a metajoke about javaright
class names in c
but still works on 3 billion devices
im not touching java kotlin is wayyyyy better than java
107 isnt this precisely python
this was objectively funny 
how can someone who is not utterly insane vote js for the best programming language of all time 
240 you can barely hear his kids somewhere around
i hope the new nokia phones would be run java i wanna play java games
terrible style of video making but java is the number one punkt
im a j2ee developer and im still using java 8  i dont care about the main function because i dont use it
i hate java  that is all  just more crap  the javascript looks like old java and the new java looks like old javascript is so true
java is past dude
204 that line about the new java website looking 10 years out of date instead of 20 got me d
youtube_test2댓글작성12345界上最的距 生死おかまが  
yeah some people never got over the java is used for complex enterprise applications  
108 oh yeah drop the semicolon
lol your meme videos are much better than the 100 seconds series love your character development
java loved by ram companies
where did you get the stupid idea from that it left
missed opportunity to make fun of minecraft
personally i like all of javas boiler plate theres no guess work to what a function receives or returns
as a java developer i still like the verbose of java
as a python dev i feel offended
minecraft is moving away from java so there is no point s
i love how when i go to javas website i think that its malware not java
good video watched the entire thing over the course of a couple of weeks

are shell scripts you create saved in the bin folder if not where do shell scripts get saved
"after seeing thumbnail 
c laughing in the corner"
at 331 there is an upside down rag with russia written on it so dont watch this channel
pytube is not showing even after download
really good 
the only youtube channel that i actually like first then watch the video
thanks love the cat pic also have you considered a downloader for youtube to a specific that that gets the newest videos as they are uploaded

hi imc can u pls tell me where did you created the file imgs and editimg is in the same folder which you created the project or the python directory
wow i was a jock once and this video just changed how i look at solving problems of the world i was so narrow in my thinking  really thanks 
hi bro  plz tell how to create our own app
errno 2 no such file or directory editedimgscat_editedjpg
do a tutorial on a simple inventory tool would help me a ton with work
a little fast for me but thank you
bro i tried that pytube project  but it resolution is in average level only is there any alternatives for this
so with the youtube downloader would this work to download complete playlists and convert them to hd audio mp3
whatever click noise youre using when you pop words up on screen please stop its stabbing in the ear holes
these are great projects thanks for sharing  excited to implement the pdf merger
great job bravo 
i got a problem at 857  i dont get anything when downloading
is there a pdf converter that would be extremely useful
has anyone managed to do this with pydroid3
why use argv0 instead of input for the youtube project when i write link  input the code works otherwise get an error
thanks man
"very impressive 
m a complete beginner had no clue about the code but love the out come cant wait to be able to do stuff like this"
useful projects but explanation is not beginner friendly i dont understand what most of these methods do
awesome video thanks a lot man
even for me who is 50 years old and not very knowledgeable in coding this seems like something i could learn
and i always wonder who and where people that make library i really want to know what and how they really works what they did
lol youtube downloader  did this get demonetised 
these are great ideas and if you play with it and custom it then it will teach you a lot
now whe hope that youtube isnt mad at you
youre a game changer dude
couldnt resolve an issue on the downloader  the certificate ssl
youtube has made some changes with the links so the yt vid download  video wont work untill pytube library is updated
sir what is your operation system
you are quite funny
do you also have a tutorial for project mbappe
i dont know anything about python but this makes me want to learn im assuming python runs on a mac right what do i need to do to get started
interesting projects need to investigate more python libraries
"great inspiration 

im only beginning to learn and this was super helpful keep them coming"
thx for adding timestamps and nice video 
can someone explain where i should place the img input and output files left side of the screen is cut off and im still getting used to vscode
so informative thanks a lot
too many cuts
thumbs up
i use gimp it is free but in gimp you can see your edits first hand
this video is friggin awesome
"1 photo editor
2 youtube video downloader
3 pdf merger"
this is the best free software ive seen respect
what ide you are using
"lol you got my like for that kitten
well i do appteciate the python content also ofcourse "
great content
omg it was awesome i was looking for some information and this guy made it completely clear in minuts ty brother
if you use pyinstaller you can turn it into an executable
great video my questions is how do you know that coding file is the same that you want in output
noticed your name and realized that you are finnish thats cool
very nice information sir
try to always show the screen cos the attention is on the content
potato internet
outstanding
the soft of gaia it really isnt
i will be back to this one 
first video of yours i watched half way into the video i liked subscribed and commenting awesome
your utube code argv1 index is out of range bruh
brilliant cheers mate 
thank you so much great content
jesus love you  and he will back soon
011useless but the video is still great
is pycharm ok for this
in second one youtube one if you are facing ssl or cert error as first time users check this out as solution 
which text editor do you use
let my guess the youtube video downloader only works on mac and not windows edit i got it thank you for this video
i actually did the second one before watching the video
for people on windows  for the youtube downloader  from vs code the terminal command is  ytdownloaderpy 
python just massacred r they folded with posit and sold out its over
amazing tutorial i tried project 2 in a few minutes sucessfully thanks a lot
brilliant
ive done projects 1 and 3 but that youtube downloader is so cool thanks for sharing
where you from
it is sayin list is out of range when i try to do the youtube downloadercan you help
love the content
hi can you please share your vs code extension and settings you are using im just fan of it 
"nice really loving python and youtube tutorial videos
 new subscriber "
thanks ork great vid
pff tictactoe is useless shit
thank you
for some reason the eighter the program or the imports dont work on linux or windows for me thats just what coding is i guess lol
thank you
"014  when you said we wont be building anything wank my inner brit was immediately interested

nice one mate"
"power of python  best and 
fastest
easy to learn lang in the world"
"link  argv1 
it says error out of range im totally new to python
what am i doing wrong"
id like to learn more shell scripting and handy ways of incorporating python  ooh  especially something scheduled
thats some value i really appreciate to receive had fun watching thanks for sharin
its showing this list index out of range to me what to do now
for yt i prefer ytdlp but does same thing i guess

"where can i get one of those potato internet adapters
i asked at my local supermarket and for some reason they looked at me like i was a loon p"
"thanks a lot broski
just too much chit chat but eh your video wouldnt reach the minimum 10 min for youtube monetization otherwise "
beautiful
are you a wizurd
damn blew me away with that first project you were not kidding that you wouldnt be doing games as projects subscribed
funny how my mate made the second project for our main project and a week later this same video probably popped up in my recommendations 
"i like the idea that youre building useful scripts instead of useless things
keep it up  "
great tutorial i want to learn more from you i want to be your student 
where do you find all these libraries
when you referred to the typical example projects as wank projects i had to hit subscribe because ive found my people
great tutorials and videos keep working on your very useful projects you saved me at least one problem with the youtube code thanks
bro you are the best liked and subscribed 
automation using libraries sucks imho you dont get any experience with requests
cool 
argv1 gives me an error that list index is out of range
the pdf merger writes to the output files multiple times since the write function is inside the for loop
cool projects 
just my quick two cents not everybody uses apple but use windows or linux so perhaps have those files on your site as well
dude pytube is a game changer especially since i found you can do audio only thanks so much
this is just something unreal thank you for that
amazing video learnt something new today
"the pip comand to install pytube doesnt work 
what do"
thank you
hey dude you have tried you may know how its done but you dont know how to deliver a lesson you dont know how to teach the beginners
very nice thank you 
cant you also use argparse instead of bash scripting
c is god though python is for kids
what editor are you using here
im gonna show you how to cheat youtube while using youtube 
amazing tutorial
gonna have to learn some python
another great tip for merging pdfs on a mac is after highlighting them left click  quick actions  create pdf
it took the picture of a cat that made me like
some of awe
use pathlib in project 3 you can just pathdirglobpdf
i wish i could tag my university professor on this video so he can learn how to teach this subject
excellent description cleared things up for me thank you
these ibm shorts have become my goto to get up to speed on technical concepts quickly i hope you continue to produce these thanks a lot
so ml is the big part of ai
appreciate the fact that youre writing everything backward to make ppl understand
that is an excellent and straightforward explanation loved it thank you
bravo
almldl  ai
ibm forces their employees to learn to write backwards so that their see through whiteboard tech has a use case
good stuff well explained thanks a lot
can u guess which hand he is writing with  its the right hand imo  try to guess how they processed the video
your socalled venn diagrams are wrong ml doesnt fully overlap dl dl overlaps most if not all of ml not the other way around
love it how simply and concisely he explained
brilliant explanation well explained yet very precise
amazing  teaching technique made is super simple to understand
great video
i define ai as the point an time a machine can improve itselfs while man cant an ai qauntum computer will be made within a few years
how about ml is like the brain of the ai
awesome job id love to see a video that discusses generative ai as well
you rocked it  best ever explanation
the  best explanation  
so distracted by the seamless way hes writing backwards 
aihuman in reason im so impressed
then ml belongsto ai  ml  ai p
there will be no jobs in ai and machine learning so stop investing in this companies it is just a hype and at end not yielding anything meaningfull
thanks simple explained
thank you so much for share video
thank you so much for share video
great clarity
wow very understandable explanation you explained it effectively
"10
13
11
  2"
am i trippin or is he writing backwards i mean if you look from his perspective he is writing from right to left respect for that
the way he wrote everything backward was so cool
simple easy clear explanation
ibm the company of epic fails watson haha
very easy explanation  well done 
of a human who picks which human
but we use ml 99 of the time for cv nlp etc ai is conceptual ml is application
im really fascinated by ai i work in finance but dream of becoming an ai developer im 25 and want to swap fields but idk where to start
ai  ml
sounds dangerous to be working on something that could one day be smarter than we are
using his definition of ai 37 then a pocket calculator is ai no
no wonder stats majors tend to be really good ml researchers after attending grad school of course
how the video was recorded what kind of tablet is this its amazing
my question is why are they letting us use ai for free
this guy is itself an ai masqueraded as human
ai  self awearness
not true id rather put deep learning as the super set cause it all stems from neural networks
smoooth
ai is just the overview of ml and dl
clear articulation of the ai and ml and how it related hats off
super knowledgeable thank you very much 
ai is outco e ml rl are the process
danke für die klärung der begriffe
very good teacher would love to take a class in whatever you are teaching
"now i understood ai  ml 
great explanation"
i like this definition thank you
115 baised on that we dont even have ai because out llm can even use basic logic unless if it was programmed into it 
"if ai exceeds the intelligence and capabilities of a human and a human is able to create ml  ai must be more than ml
everything is a subset of ai"
very clearly and precisely articulated
clear and concise big w 
ai is the goal ml is a way to the goal
great 
great explanation
this was very helpful thank you
ai  ml
in a way we can say ai as a mission ie we are trying to achieve human like intelligence in machine which is ai and ml and dl are ways to go for it
simply explain about the machine learning and artificial intelligence
what is the screen he is writing on 
 thanks i learned a lot nice overview
"how much is data science related to ai or its subsets
how much is it not"
youre right im tired hearing misleading definitions
but how is it that vision or nlp are not considered machine learning  its still machines learning how to process language or else
very good video like it
no matter what ai cannot come close to human intelligence it will augment but never equal
definitely not ai
omg he made it super simple
how is he writing on the other side of the glass and we see it correctly
how is no one talking about the fact that he learned to write backwards perfectly to do this video
how do you write from that side 
does he write in reverse 
many words  little meaning
ai also contains olfaction crucial if you want ai to be able to distinguish mousse au chocolat from its lesser pleasant counterpart 
cette vidéo est géniale synthétique et structurante  bravo à linterlocuteur pour cette explication simple et condensée
this was worthless please delete
sicknessthis guy needs to read up on what a human is
"the video and the production quality is insane i have been on youtube for so long but this is the one
history"
thank you
great video tnx
that mirrored writing tho
thanks
in 426 i think he actually use text to speech nice one
where does generative ai fit in here how is that similar or different than dl and nlp is not ml
how is he writing flipped letters so smoothly
would you explain how this writing on the screen works is there a glass in front of the presenter if yes is he writing inverted
do bubbles have ai that allows them to compute minimal surfaces
reversible compooting is da foooooooture
just remove the a for artifical and the m for machine and ask the difrence intelligence vs learning learning is a feature of intelligence
a venn diagram that isnt circles literally unwatchable
ai is the output of mldl
the first clear and concise explanation of this ive found awesome thank you
and whats relation between ai and data science
basically ml is a subdomain of bbc
thank you so much sir for this clarification  im really impressed with the simplicity in your explanation
there are always going to be people like me who deliberately try to piss them off thats until they start runing their hunterkiller programs
ai is trained using ml but when it integrate with llm it will be a scary form of intelligence in the future
are those videos all one continuous take or the editing is so good i cant notice the cut great content really well explained
so in short all dl is ml and aiall of ml is ai but all of ai isnt mllikewise all of ml isnt dl and obviously all of ai isnt dl
ai is imitating human intelligence and it is around since the late 50s and ml is one tool to achieve this
aha   now i get it thanks a ton  very clearly explained
search for machinelearnthis 
his voice reminds me of bruce willis on that movie armageddon
equation of ai  human capabilities is not a solid equation
brilliant simple introductory explanation on ai vs ml cheers
i would have thought that ai is a subset within ml  doesnt machine learning also apply to vision for example
excellent
simple concise and well explained best explanation ive come across so far on ml vs ai
lol nlp and cv models are done using neural nets so they should be inside the deep learning box
an amazing video and explanation so easy to understand for those with no background to ai
simple eloquent and precise  one of the best ai essential videos ever   thank you 
so informative thanks for sharing
well explained it tackles the confusion mathematically thanks for sharing
amazing sir love you 1000 
thank you crystal clear now for the three concepts of almldl
thank you very much sir for this overview explanationi support ibm since i was young studentgood luck
very interesting thanks 
to sum up ml is integral part of ai
im perplexed is he really skilled at writing backwards or is it some cool program
lucid and well explained how do you manage to write reverse
i want to know if ibm thinks or define ai in this way or its a universal understanding of ai vs ml 
how about large scalamachine
nicely explained
good backwards writing
i love ai topic thanks for sharing such great content 
exactly 
good stuff more journalists need to watch this type of psa to stop inadvertently spread misinformation
but classic statistics is supervised machine learningwhere pearson fisher and neyman ai researchers
seems like an anthrocentric description
i hate that you try to make a differentiation ai is just fancy ml which is fancy statistical analysis
"i like how the human drawing by him is
"
thanks for this very much
big shout out to the creator for explaining everything so clearly and interestingly but most impressive to me writing everything backwards well done
ive been asking this question for over a year and could never get a clear answer
very good tks for the content
combine all ai into one programe
yall need to get them lufs up super quiet audio
sounds confusing without proper booms on the material
perfect explanation of diff between ai and ml i have seen so far 
ai  human is wrong its still ai if its only a fraction of human level intelligence
sir explanation was very clear the content was really easy to understand please talk about reinforcement learning
thanks clearly explained
another great video from jeff and the ibm team
excellent
very well explained this is a common confusion and it has been tackled brilliantly thanks
thanks for the explanation i remember back in university we also have a thing in ai subject called expert system
amazing
no man ia its included in ml
clearly explained
yes on point
thanks very interesting
 ty for preaching
waiting for more ai and ml contents like this  
guys i decided to learn it in university i still in high school what do you think 
more machine learning content letsgoo
"i watched this video 315361 times

now i have over a year of experience in ml"
why you sound like neetcode
in 154 seconds
ml please
accuracy is not an error function but a metric for classification task an error function can be binary cross entropy
chatgpt is one of those machine learning models developed
helpful thank you
i will add machine learning in my portfolio and hope fireship will hire me
its crazy how much info you can deliver in 100 seconds great video
بالتوفيق
so satisfied
please do machine learning for haters thatd be awesome
wheres the best place to start for my dirt poor friend who wants to master these topics
so its just a chain of if else statements
100 seconds of great value man how do you do that
i love how your project will identify the dog image as cat xd
need pytorch in 100 seconds
more machine learning content
012 i think you are taking the biology metaphor too literally artificial neurons have very little to do with biological neurons
now do machine learning in 100 hours
i tried to make a machine learning algorithm specifically designed to processgenerate sentences the first thing it said was eat shit i am a dishwasher
this video is 9999 accurate
is there anything about coding that you dont know i wonder 3
amazing video loved it 
awesome thanks a lot for this
glorified predictive engine
ai isnt just about classification and prediction lets call it extrapolation it can also be used for interpolation and generation of fake new data
make a video of machine learning in javascript without any library
i think im a machine
accuracy is not a loss function
such an interesting topic
thanks your video are always amazing
next video idea  lua in 100sec
more please
146 it is a tiger obviously
cat for sure
ai is also cat lover 92 sure
watching this after a class on kmeans clustering
im a developer and ai scares the sht out of me
bruteforce with save feature
can someone explain why is python the language of choice for data scientists
would love to see some unsupervised learning explained 
slight detail you cannot minimize the accuracy instead you usually use the logloss also called crossentropy
machine learning looks fancy and high tech but its not that complicated fields like computer game quantum computing are much more complicated
now i need ml in 100 days 
thank you
can you explain artificial intelligence in 100 seconds   deep learning in 100 seconds
jeff is my favourite tech youtuber
more ml content
please can you make haskell in 100 seconds
hi mark zukerburg
want a ml tutorial please
well done iam addicted now to this channel content very informative and very pleasant thank you and thumb up 
can confirm cat 100
perform a task without programming does not make that much sense more like make decisions without heuristics
more machine learning content pls
web scraping in 100s please
205 is good knowledge in short time
the dog with the cat ears is spot on
do machine learning in long
id love to see more machine learning on your channel from the very basics if possible

2 minute 30 second  100 seconds  ok
you are a rude person you did very wrong with qazi
really interesting great content
you mixed up ai and ml but its good video though
you teach soooooo well bro
omg i was waiting so long for this sadly there was no    and beyond  i would still love a tutorial to set up this stuff
will you please make a video about rss in 100 seconds 
yes for more ml content in the future thanks for making a good channel
how much do they earn
everyone focuses so much on classification it would be great to get some good content about regression
"input doggo wid hat
prediction cat 92 sure 
 good example to have for intro"
been waiting for this
make videos on react component life cycle plz
pls make a video on 100 seconds of solidity
another cleverprogrammer video nice 
tf or pytorch in a and beyond
yes please more ml content
"ml in 5 seconds
machine learning is a bunch of if and else statements"
thanks for clear explanation
pretty cool content
the video was 154s not 100s
you can learn more in 100 seconds here than you learn in 4 years in the university
your videos are awesome
more machine learning please
99 accuracy in you video not bad at all if you make a convolutional neural network to classify cats and dogs that would be an awesome next step
explain big data in 100 seconds
"i never knew one could boil down an entire study into 100s but you did
now i want and beyond please"
machine learning 100sec degree acquired
i would definitely buy a fireship course from you on training a model and deploying it to the cloud
was i the only one expecting jeff to start with we start by typing npm install machinelearning
save this video for later watch  you ll need so many times  the best short video in ml  thanks 
nice 100 seconds d only thing i thought was missing was the aspect of overtraining and overfitting otherwise a nice introduction 
watching it as a data scientist
do you use machine learning to learn what video we want to see you upload next
yes please more ml
i rarely comment but i had to on this video please keep up the content on this topic i would like to see some long form vids about it thanks
"is this a dog or a cat
pure brilliance ensues"
please do ai in 100 seconds ml and other things sometimes confuse us with the term ai as a whole
go beyond 100 secs
"love the video
could you do something like this about lodash  and it would be awesome if you include some examples of functions 
thanks in advance"
hold up bro i thought you were only good at css
we want more ml videos 
 loved more on this topic please
looking forward to seeing your machine learning vids
always a pleasure to watch fireship videos
need more ml content
yess i want more of ai
"yes will be waiting for more machine learning content in  seconds
do tensorflow in  seconds"
can you make a video explaining machine learning and deploying it on the cloud
after a century this guy introduce python in his video 
more machine learning content
yes please more about data science
how much does it cost to host an ml through a webapp or phone app
more machine learning content please 
i would like to see a tensorflow video
the only epsisode i can umderstand fully 
cat 92 sure xdddd
there are pretty good chances that youtube recommended this video to you because you have searched stuff related to ai and ml on google
this is very good 100s introduction to machine learning
damn this guy is good its just fascinating how hes able to condense such quality in just 100s 
machine learning aka the if soup
"me  ai is the future
ai  fifteen fourteen thirteen twelvteen eleventeen"
please more of this im starting a company and were taking the ml route this helps me a lot
yes more machine learning how neural network works weight bias activation function cost function backpropagation
you my idol i aspire to become like you
im wondering where you get such gifs and images you use in your videos 
garbage in turd out 
why machine learning when you can just write like a 100 if and elses
please do a simple machine learning tutorial really curious bout how it works
ml rules
"collages takes 1 year to teach ml
fireship garbage in garbage out"
definitely more machine learning content on this channel id love to dive into it with your help
your videos are away fun  educational to watch and yes more machine learning videos please truly inspiring
the people want a follow up video with a simple project
i would love to see more of machine learning from you
"nice video
would love to see more videos about linear algebra ml and ai"
amazing
more ml videos please  curious to see how a javascript developer can use ml in projects
verilog in 100 seconds 
please do tauri in 100 seconds
javascript be the better option for machine learning  beyond 100 sec  ml with js 
yes more ml content please
right on time like all the time
all the images used are to confuse the ml algorithm subtle details like this makes this channel great
"nice video i would like to see more machine learning videos dd
please make python kivy in 100 seconds"
please go beyond 100 seconds in machine learning
"college take a 1 year course on ml theory
fireship hold my 100 seconds"
awesome love this video now beyond 100 seconds of ml
more machine learning
not a good one
do web3 in 100 sec
please bro do beyond 100 secs it would be great
i now know at least 2 more things about machine learning lol
wow complex subject but i think you did very well but i know ml maybe im biased
more machine learning content please
"you what is 1  1
ml cat"
finally bro thank you 
hah stupid machine i am 9999 sure that is a dog wearing a catshaped hoodie
"great as usual  keep it up
a minor correction  accuracy is not an error function"
i love the little bits of humour that you inject into the images without acknowledging them in your audio so good 
beyond 100 sec on machine learning
this is what i do
this hurt my brain
beautifuly explained
the model was the missing part i was missing to understand thank you
the puffy tank algorithmically apologise because ticket methodically exist qua a gorgeous mimosa venomous permissible barge
great video but this is 5 years too late lol the job market is saturated and ml didnt live up to its promises 
main issue with the machine learning is finding a point of start
heres my like for the pic of the pug in cat costume 92 sure xd
great make a video on on recommendation engine with firebase analytics and firestore
people making whole courses about machine learning this guy  ill do that in 100 second
sounds interesting thanks
yes more machine learning but make sure youve read the bitter lesson by richard sutton
definitely interested in more ml content your teaching style is perfect for my learning style
this is just amazing
machine learning 3
are you a genius how come you even know about ml  can explain it well can you explain stock marketfed printing money  bitcoin too
more ml content please
where is the difference between machine learning and deep learning
cat 92 sure 
im also 92 sure thats a cat
cnn networks are already old news now though transformers is the cool thing now 
fireship if you chose to go beyond would the content be taught in javascript or python
cryptography in 100 seconds
yes more ml
more more 
well explained
searching data structures algortihms in 100 seconds
you could make more videos on ml even separated videos on image classification speech recognition reinforced learning frameworks and so on
more ml content sure sounds fantastic
i got interests in ml exactly 5 hours ago and you made this video  i must say you are a mind reader
i challenge you to go beyond 100 seconds
your example pictures of dogs kinda looking like cats are delightful
definitely would love more machine learning on this channel
summarizing a complex topic in such a short amount of time takes real skill great video
ml content
finally
"0210
most reliable mlmodel i have seen ever 

"
hell yeah bring on ml examples
more 
yep clearly a cat
well finally i can apply for a data scientist position 
machine learning is the process of having a computer learn from its experience rather than explicitly detailing what it should do
"hey can you please make videos covering various machine learning algorithms
these videos are fun to watch thanks"
"thanks for the nice video 
could you please make a full tutorial baout it that would be amazing"
learn  julia  
rss in 100 second
wow that last one animation 
how about julia in 100 seconds
thank you beautiful work
there was some kind of tensorflow demo here in the past but it outdated now 
tiger dog would probably leave my classification models clueless 
more about machine learning plx
yes would love more ml in this channel also i flanked the numerical analysis and math courses of my degree should i learn those now are they essential
more ml
so  the tricky part is the model right
more ml asap
brainjs is really awesome
please do people know the purpose of the dislike buttonwhats not to like about this godtier simplification of technical complexities
more ml
can you explain graph algorithms in 100 seconds
love how this made more sense than 20 hours of courses on machine learning at cost hundreds of dollars
please do more machine learning
"vice was not clear in between 
cheap sound in between plz fixed it sir"
"227 mintues have passed
him this has been machine learning in 100 secs"
"i have been suffering for 1 year
thank you brave sensei"
hmmm isnt feature engineering something you dont want to do and therefore use ml instead
more of these ml videos would be great
i was just thinking about learning ml yesterday and you just posted a video great timing love it
ai preceded the internet
awesome  more on machine learning from you please 
petition for beyond 100 sec with tensorflowjs or skit learn i know you already have a tensorflow tutorial in your channel but that would be epic d
"machine learning




behind the scenes if else"
yes i would love some more machine learning content
please we want a full video
nice vid i would like to see more about quantum machine learning and horizon qcs classical to quantum code translation
more ml please
actually quite accurate summary every ml student sould watch this before starting lectures
what is that keyboard on 223 is that just a render or real
this video is impossible
finally i can add machine learning specialist to my portfolio
i would really appreciate if you continue putting tutorials on machine learning and ai it would help a lot of developers
a question always in my mind how do you know all of these things you explain in your channel i cannot learn 10 of things you know how amazing are you
make full free tutorial video pls

next video is machine learning app im waiting for it
so this year im doing my masters in the ai field what are some interesting ideas for the final project yall can give me
is rust good as 1st language or is it easy on beginners
crablang crablang
if you watch this video at 2x speed youll learn rust in 50 seconds
in 100 s does not look like that complicated
the tittle of this video in spanish literally translates the word rust
what do people that get hire as rust programmers even do
