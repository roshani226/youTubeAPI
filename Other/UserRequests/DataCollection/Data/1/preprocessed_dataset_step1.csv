the video is very useful
i think the series of books thats kinda fun is called the head first series such as head first java theyre good books
really great video
i am a little confused  isnt web dev a backend thing  isnt frontend web dev an oxymoron  i new at this go easy on me
awesome video and great info   tho her public speaking could improveit seems like she doesnt put emphasis on anything
yo this is great 3
i liked it first 
watch the full webhooks course 
mr beast
please course bash ncurses
hey yotob stop smoking weed while coding why there is no indicator when i press the like button
observer pattern
webhooks and callbacks are kind of similar except the fact that we need to call the callback and for webhook we need to subscribe them
it is kind of like a more sophisticated version of an rss feed
learn more about html with this crash course 
repair me if im wrong with js and html you can make a button to show password
what plugging are you using for the autocomplete on vs code
please how do i make videos like this
try to new tips for subscribes this old tips
does anyone know what software she is using for the recording
why is this a video
great

learn full stack web development 
hala is such a great teacher
well good luck if your business has european customers
у тебя колонок нет  или это модно наушники на голове носить
i dont think this is a good nor sustainable practice
instead u should make how to add fonts from your device otf
learn to use locally not links they may break
oh boy what are you guys doing in dev if you cannot figure out even how to use a link tag
web devs please dont embed more of googles things into your page especially if you can use websafe fonts instead
please stop embedding random crap in web pages this is the worst type of pattern
do not use google fonts in the eu or youll be open to lawsuits due to gdpr infringements
thanks
first to comment  thanks for the awesome content
watch the full python course 
instead of this we can do from this map
"omg no 
do n  2 for n in numbers instead"
thanks
amazing
could you not have just run the function with the list as a parameter
sunsfan is that you
in terms of performance which is better map or for
keep the shorts coming
"could have just used a list comprehension
result  number  2 for number in numbers"
i like to memorymap big gig files using gnucobol  on linux mmap
how to do it in list comprehension
thanks for explaining map
python map returns a map object not a list and that why we send the result to list
wait what is the variable a for
such an easy to understand and memorable explanation

async await gives us synchronous looking code without the downside of writing synchronous code call back hell

wes bos is a great speaker he makes it so simple and explains it so well
the elephant in the room is that when you have to wait for data before doing some processing then it doesnt matter how performant your code is
great shoutout to wes bos for a brilliant and clear explanation
wes is brilliant asyncawait not so much
finally i get it thank you wes
brilliant
thanks a lot wesbos

absolutely amazing video
this was brilliant thank you
great content thank you
excellent content in 28 min better than hours long videos thanks
is this working in windows 7 
simply explained with a very detailed walkthrough for quick journey from uploading the dataset to visualization  storytelling great video
okuse the count measure instead of number of records its available in the measures tab
it was all fund and games until this moment 2128
start from 644
a  great video but how did they calculate the number of passengers who not survived
if you are using the 2020 and above version of tableau use the count measure instead of number of records its available in the measures tab
fabulous
succinct and insightful several visualization concepts and walkthrough in just 30 minutes thanks for this
completing this tutorial made me feel like a real data analyst for the first time since i started studying
thanks for this
thankyou 
very helpful thank you
i love this tutorial thank you
great videofor a data analyst interview
so easy to follow and understand thanks
great content thank you
processing data is not science its a tool or filter if you like tableau is a data visualisation tool do not conflate science with data processing
thanks a lot
hi which screen recordingcapturing tool are you using nice video 
thankyou
"very useful
hats off to this guy"
very informative tutorial nice job
i downloaded the tableau desktop 202127 but somehow it only offer me 14day trial its not like free why is that

recently started using tableau thank you for your explaination but i think i will stick to powerbi instead 
youtubeua
wonderful video
thank you big
great video
all these software is basically like power bi dashboard
that was a great video thank you

"great class

natasha samuel"
how to integrate this in my website
hello  may i ask what course in college or 2nd course better to take to become a data analyst thank u
does every data scientist use windows 7
god bless you freecodecamp
how do we predict who survived in the test data set
why did we use sum as a measure for the variable age if we want to know the distribution of age we should go for counts right
2831 hmm well i would argue that you can do it pretty well with power bi
thank you for making this video
tableaue is glamourized excel pivot tble and charts nothing special
this is helpful thanks  got to learn so much
shitty tutorial
you should probably look up the definition of munging
there is no data science in  thisits  just basics  on tableu

nodejs is overrated
more of these shorts please

brotha look at the camera

whats the easiest and fastest coding software to learn to start working remotely on line
nodejs and fast dont belong in the same sentence
chat gpt is better
how node is fast its literally the slowest javascript runtime
is she reading a script here for a 30 second video and needed two takes anyway why are her eyes nowhere near the camera
node is fast come on thats not the reason we use node
get out of node an react an migrate to python or c
i was told and read that node is bad and django is better for example
кто ты воин
i prefer vue js and python
react simple and easy to use i agree is a good option but i wont associate those terms with it
no it will not generate a positive reaction its a fckn pointless short

i have a question access modifiers public private and protected are not part of encapsulation
simple and straight to the point
me who did not know how to play chess game
best oop explanatoin 
im too stupid for this
am i the only one who struggle keeping up with the presentation because of the way he pause while speaking 
this is by far best explanation of oop i have ever heard thanks 
105 st
thank you for explaining the concept
brilliant
howsoever animation u use  traditional textual study has its own taste and advantage
this is a chess guide 
it was really clear explanation thanks for your work it would be perfect to make sound also clear but its not so necessary _
i know javascript only so is it a good language to learn oops
great explanation thank you
gettinggetters and settingsetters are not the languageneutral terms are they  i thought the languageneutral terms were accessors and mutators  no
im hearing a lot of paralles  between programming and society
basically stuck on methods arrays  and objects thats a huge disadvantage
honest to god i cant believe this information is free wow 
stamo 2255

thank you so much for this course its so pleasing to listen to

this was really helpful it made me understand encapsulation abstraction inheritance and polymorphism  worth my time
this is an exceptionally clear explanation of oop  well done
im a complete beginner to programming and this is so well explained that even a illiterate like me can understand
great video i wish i watched this when i first started oo

what is there to dislike about this video people cannot be happy with anything _ nice video keep up the good work
the examples r super clear absolutely recommended to watch
i dont understand everything that seems usefull with abstraction seems to me that i can do it with polymorphism i dont understand
u forgot to mention method overriding
the most important thing which is missing in this video is taking about the money

cors makes me question my life choices
just use js as front end
"cors in one word

how the hell you do that im trying to understand cors for a day already you did it in 100 secs what
nice and simple
this goes too fast maybe the same information in 200 seconds would be more useful
cors is idiotism in 2022
wait no xss is 100 seconds follow up
thank you you rock
thanks
i like the body scan by the security guy
now i understand what cors is just took a minute 
this is something i didnt learn at college when i made my first project for a customer i was like bruh what the hell is this error
now you just need to go over java certificates all these security features can be so confusing
you are the prophet of web developers
this channel is an all you can eat buffet 
thanks for this
your explanations are magical i now understand cors from a very fundamental perspective
cors will end my life
why is this security mechanism there to prevent easy to build phishing sites
"why does that logo look familiar




oh i know"
cors error almost drive me to insanity thanks for clear doubts much appreciated 
i cant even code hello world but thank you for this informative
what exactly does it mean to preflight 
you are the best
duck cors duck legacy useless rules
cors errors are really pain in the ass

very nice and fast explanation thanks
why we are not required to put cors package with express nowadays 
the bane of my existence
this was extremely clear and concise much better than reading all those confusing articles online
this error pissed me off the most gwtf
or or oryou could pipe in the resources through your backend like a moron
now explain why it exists to begin with because that is the actual thing most developers dont seem to get
very nice explanation of cors and just using sample words
god bless you
omg after all this years i finally understand it
thanks
you explained this better in 100 seconds than my professors did in college over 5 months
if you go for the fastest growing worst case scenario then you always have job security poor performing code needs lots of maintenance
these short form videos really help me learn better than long lessons with power point slides especially with my adhd
your videos have the best visualizations thank you fireship
yes thank you
better than my compsci 101 lecture
so how do i always keep my algorithms logarithmic i assume theres more to it than avoiding nested for loops but i use those all the time rn 
oh my god this one was actually a hundred seconds
hah i skipped straight through this over some 8 minute or even 30 min videos i understand niw what i need to know
i honestly have a really hard time with big o and im not looking forward for the technical interviews ill do in the future
this man turns concepts in uni from on to olog n 
you have the gift to explain something allegedly complex in a simple manner i salute you
simply amazing
"what do you say at 0035
it takes exactly 1 year of time
i dont see that anywhere on the graph there should be subtitles"
"my worst case
on"
"him exponential complexity is awful
me i have triple factorial complexity is that ok"
false
can we get a more in depth video of bigo explaining how to calculate it for space and time separately
best 100 productive seconds ive ever seen thanks man
thanks for explaining what it actually is everyone else dives into explaining the different kinds of bigo notations
what if there are multiples of o n2 would 5 of them be like o5n2 what if there are like thousands of n2s but also a single n3s you still mark it as n3
so fast grow  slow execution right
some 10min videos couldnt explain it this well
and then there is factorial
what does the cap n mean i keep seeing people use a cap n or a lower case n and sometimes both why whats the difference
this video is amazing explained so much in such a short period of time
thank you for this
i had to pause the video to stop laughing at 031
bigo notation in 10 seconds fx  ogx xx_0  lim_xx_0 fxgx exists
make a video on how to calculate big o
i think i finally understood it
bro for some reason its today that i understood what big o notates 8 years as a software eng lol thanks
99 of these nerds have never even given a female a big o
really i just know create crud program and what is this 
lemme just save this so i can watch this lateraight off to classes now
does anyone know the background music
very important video
something something roger smith something something dorthy wayneright something something bigo joke
only 99 seconds i want my money back
thank you all the other online definitions made it so hard for me but i finally understand what bigo notation means
poor me finally understanding what big o means in 100s after wasting 25h lecture hours for nothing
cmake in 100 seconds
lol that kid crying is literally me in interview 
my brain is just too broken now just finished some express api development lesson
so big it has a theme song  
slow down slow down baby youre talking too fast boy its impossible to understand what youre trying to say
what in hell is this video about 
thank you mate thank you so much
your content is easy to understandpls continue good work
this was amazing really you made it very simple to understand in a short time thank you
just if you know the story behind the crying kid you wouldnt use it as a meme 
in which editor you are making videos
this 100 seconds was taught to us in college for several hours yet we didnt had this level of clarity
i want more
i still have no clue whats going on lol
"my brain after watching this 
big no"
and ive learned nothing
dude please make a full verison of this please please please
it can get even worse with n factorial
i dont know why this guy has 740k subscribers only
i have taken up this mission to watch all your videos and like it
this saved me like 1 day worth of listening to shitty online classes
026 lmaooo 
bigooo
great
someone commented using the bigo notation on my code question on stackoverflow and now i know what it actually means haha
which applications do you use for making video
thanks for this it would be nice to see a video on how to calculate the big o notation of functions 
your editing skills are impressive
you know youre a programmer when you write  even when writing math statements
"027 do anyone know who this cild 
i know his parent died in syria and when she asked him about them he cry"
to the point 
and then you have on factortial or big oh no complexity
ahhahazgahs ağlayan çocuk türk değil miydi
just excellent
amazing lessons  dream lessons
after this video i think that im ready for interviews
100 seconds in youtube  4 months course in university
the length of this channel videos has constant time complexity
best 100 sec of my time
just subscribed
love these videos keep them coming
i remember bézier joined the fc once and gave everyone there this amazing demonstration what a mad lad
oh yeah i read about this while looking at godots documentation
"and guess what i got only 2 linear search and binary  rest is bad as the 
time complexity and big o dose not allow me to even understand what it is"
the formula shown next to the two point bézier curve is for a 3 point curve but beat
mostly we use it to calculate mouse paths for runescape bots
this curve principle has high learning curve
a bit imprecise it does not calculate the intersection between the points at all
this guy should have a statue
"woaww
uibezierpath is used in ios app development to draw curves 
"
quake 3 was the first video game to implement this
the baguette curve
perfectly explained i didnt really understand before this
common french w
svg uses basis splines as well to denote curves
time to draw that single line 
awesome
i seriously thought it was me who invented the bezier curve which was during 1990 through for a 3d swivel development team
regular show voice or is it just me
this algorithm is used lot as you may find it function as lerp slerp
the spoiler in his name 
this guys algorithm is the basis of most of the things i do today wow 
bro took fine ill do it myself to next level
a simple  let me just stop you there
this guy knows nothing
cocorico
it took me 3 years to realize why bezier curves are awesome the formula can be applied to x and y components separately
i learned about the curve on a mac lc575 in claris works could never quite master it
a french car engineer did something useful
or just draw it
bézier sound like baisiez which mean fucked
ty  this made curving sô easier
nice uh  its french
finally i found what is bezier curve  i use blender
on dit quoi on dit merci pierre
legend straight to the f point
hats off to that car who made this man invent new art style in programming
why didnt you mention de casteljau he was as important as bezier in their development
easeinout
if you do a lot of animation those bezier curse look so smooth
no one talks about paul de casteljau damn citroën 
please learn how to pronounce names of companies why di you amaricans just think they can speak any language bad and the world will manage no stop 
didnt paul de casteljau come up with the algorithm dont rewrite history
the cad software i use calls it a spline
amazing thank you
thats crazy
wtf i just had as a question in my exam
jawdrop
wait its not pronounced belzier
guy renamed every straight line after himself
there so simple and beautiful literally just linear interpolation
these would be great for aimbots
"the open source competitor of adobe illustrator is inkscape
blender does have bezier curves too just to be equal comparison"
vive le fronce
fier dêtre français
sheesh
so close on the name the é in bézier is pronounced ay so bayzeeay
why is the three point line called the quadratic while the four point line called the cubic bezier
i love videos like this inventors will never get enough appreciation for what theyve done for humanity
who just used pen tool half hour ago before watching this video 
he decided to change the course of history 
that has been always very confusing for me
this is not software engineering though
carmack still has nightmares about implementing bezier curves in quake 3 arena
this is so cool i was using this when i was highschool to drawing on corel a vexel
"you talking about splines

those crashed my poor old pc all he time"
he is a hero for every modern day designer 
now i understand why cars have curved shapes
"guy didnt like jagged jones so he designed his own revolutionary math principle

just an average tuesday"
and here i thought the french only contributions to the world were cuisine and bad mannersand horrible cars
i use bézier curves every single day in design
splines 
simple algorithm haha right
its insane how trying to find a solution for a personal problems can change the way mankind works
soo  baguettes were invented before and were a car accidents
the fact that everyone else didnt know
i didnt expected that programming and drawing software even computers existed at that much past 1960s
this guy knows how to draw a perfect circle
danke
write an essay on how a bézier curve is calculated it must be at least 5 pages long
merci les français
de casteljau played the same role in their development why didnt tou mention him
dude really saved my after effects career
this man is a god among men
misato car
adsad
i love how they say simple algorithm 
read quran
knowledge
your voice
your content is gold thank you
hey can u explain oop in 10 seconds next video
my god did you explain it really well
wait a minuit thats it   ohhhh daym its just 100 seconds ok then
he promised us to explain promise in 100 seconds
thank you best part of this channel is that its been high quality for years do even if youre new you can watch old videos and learn something new
so i watched the video and now i wait for understanding it 
amazing
thank you for explaining this so clearly and precisely
it was like a teaser of javascript promise
absolutely amazing video very well explained this channel in general is a lot of help studying cs at university
exceptional explanation
best explaination of promises that i could find on the internet even the paid course i am taking is not explaining this well
thank you i got my uni exams tomorrow and im watching this video  to cover up whatever what taught in class
i kept speed 3x so learnt in 33 secs thanks bro
omg i love you content thanks
that was great 
still dont get it
damn i finally get it
i single handedly understood promises from knowing a 2 to a 500 in 98 seconds
"a man who knows his stuff
thank you"
it is not enough
music name please
"a promise represents a value that is unknown now but may become known in the future
js promises in one line great job"
great video dont forget that your callbacks must have a return value if you want to chain them
i was promised a quality video in a 100 seconds and to my surprise it has been resolved
this explanation was the best one ive seen and its only 1 min thanks
genius
these metaphors are always dumb as shit
i wish you could make a 1hour video explaining this topic
lol this brings back bad memories hahaahahaa
"me   no puns here promise

everyone rejected"
that voice is too saturated somehow
9999 of people watching this already know what a promise is
lmao i dont know why this is so hard to grasp ive watched this video probably ten times now
"soo simple and effective description

loved it"
awesome video i get it now please do one on observables i am struggling with these in angulartypescript
i could have used this a bit earlier thanks for saving me from asynchronous hell
your videos are legit the reason for 80 of my js knowledge wtf thanks
that uber comparison was excellent really cleared it up thanks
awesome
but what happens if you never get response
and i just discovered your channel  
startvideothenwatchvideothenleavecommentcatcherror  consoleerrorerrorfinallyreturntoyoutubealgorithm
bro talk about micro tasks
many cases
thank you
isnt it just an ifelse with extra steps
computers are so flipping cool
succinctly explained 
before watching this video you made a promise that you are gonna explain promises and 100 seconds and look now you have fulfilled the promise
the mushy crocus bailly time because lotion phylogentically undress till a earthy fired tame minor crown
for the first time i had to slow down the video
imagine if the entire video was just text  promise of video at 5x18f66fdd4
greater then the hours tutorial
great explanation
nice video but javascript seems to be terrible with all those anon functions in functions d
good st
music name
this is the most absorbable video about promise that ive ever watched thank you
how on earth you get  this simplicity well explained i like the thens in the end
so straight forward video
you save my 30min
i think fireship is the best for a short briefing for literally anything
thanks for breaking it down easily some channels can take 30 mins at the end of the tutorial you still confused
thank you so much for this
bravo good approche  continue
best and clear explanation ive heard so far please make a vid on observables as well
what is better to use promises or asyncawait or are they different things
wtf is this asyncornaus thing
can you trigger a promises executor function without calling then 
this was clearer than anything i ever saw or read
amazingly simplified
is everyone cheering this video already familiar with the concept most of the videos on this channel are super nonbeginnerfriendly
watching these videos really encouraging me to do coding but i remember that i suck so i be like nevermind 
respect gotta love those 100sec videos
if you would slow down and code while explaining then people might actually understand 
looks like time interval on steroids
i love the uber analogy
wowwwww this is my favorite channel now better than some paid courses
your 100 seconds is better than my teachers 45 mins lecture
clear but the background music made it sick 3
awesome
thank you  but that was so fast i didnt get any  why in 100 seconds it ca be in 360 sec  
bro i heard you lovehate node_modules so i made a node module so you can install more node modules while deleting your node_modules
naisu 
your shorts are amazing and informative thank you
even the short are legendary
my target folder is 2gb i love rust
use yarn and avoid this hoopla
is there a python equivalent i have so many virtual environments lying around
ive done fe for 8 yrs first i heard of this ty
how about pnpm
find  name node_modules delete
but how do you know what to delete
hugeeee tyyyy
just use pnpm
oh boi this is a lifesaver  found this gem after writing a script myself 
nope real genius uses pnpm
use docker
now i know why not to be a javascript developer
didnt write one single line of code for my project but already have a few hundred files and a dozen of megabytes in the project folder
i think fireship videos are shipped to us in 15x speed
"i just asked chatgpt to code a bat file for me that does exactly this it worked perfectly first try lol

i are senior dev now"
use pnpm 
okay i needed to know that
i swear you shorts helps increase my iq or makes one think they are an idiot
"me in terminal npx npkill
terminal need to install the following packages
     npkill
ok to proceed y

lmfaoo"
oh my lord that ending gold pure gold
after you abandoned this idea
yooo maybe i can use this 8tb hdd after all
thank you
bro i create a devcontainer for every single project i write docker says hold my beer
"me a godlevel windows power user
search for node_modules on windows explorer lol"
cleared out 3 years of node modules  credit to whoever created this
amazing thanks homie
btw 8gb saved here
"omg the npkill is waaaay faster than rightclick deleting it
amazing content"
"be careful tho
you might accidentally remove npm without realizing it"
010 after you abandon the idea i do it all the time 
in js the solution to a problem is to add something this usually leads to a new problem
heaviest object in the universe good one 
love this chanel thanks for the tip
i was wondering why i had no space lol thanks
you can use pnpm it solve this problem
can anybody please tell is he explaining rocket science  im new in web dev
this saved me
ooo thats how its done
how to do for mac please 
thank you 
just learn something better than js
awesome
just now i ran npx createreactapp helloworld and just like that my 1gb storage space is gone
i got a billion dollar idea
i usually have issues with apple time machine taking up all of the space
im keeping every node project in a single folder and i had a js script that removes them after a while automatically
life saver
js is bloat
i feel like i have been looking for this for ages
this is great
you sir are a hero the videos are fast to the point and very detailed you deserve 2 million subs big pp
this is amazing af
whats it for yarn folks
"faaaaaaaakkkkkkkkk
jaaaaavaaaaaacriiiiiiiiipt"
damn  one of the greatest things i learnt today
yeah command line find and delete is superior
better use pnpm to install modules you wont even have this hassle at all
i got too carried away with this and deleted some important ones 
"this 40 seconds saved me 6gb
thank you "
deleted 13gb of node modules
the mixed node synchronously hammer because agreement perplexingly judge along a first france seemly malicious cattle
the enormous maple clearly attend because fountain visually park minus a mountainous march abashed outrageous mailman
will it delete all node_modules from my system or just from the current directory
the lucky driver dewailly contain because dinosaur ultimately number out a lopsided stamp screeching awful gold
this is i searching for a longtime
i like how you assumed that the side project idea would be abandoned lol
stop making vertical video you evil person
does it show only the unused ones
now my mac can take deep breath
is npkill delete selected module with its dependencies or not 
nice work thank you
if i remeove the node modules does that affect my project
just love recommendations to let random scripts traverse my entire filesystem nothing scary about that
if youre worried about diskspace try switching to pnpm
you da best 
"cdn  20kb
npm modules 13 gb"
thanksssssssss
i was deleting node modules 
got it asking for my contact access on mac ctrl  c
npx npkill
"i feel like i get 1 year of experience added to me with every video i watch

love you a lot man please continue with your amazing videos"
use pnpm guys it can share node_modules between projects using hardlink which helps npm install faster and make efficient use of storage space
so much info in 100s
better than explaination than the shitty guy at bits and byte of networking course
great video for people who have previously learned computer networking but need a refresher on certain parts
sorry i got confused when it comes to dns i cant understand

can you do cs degree in 100 seconds
cant even get the initialism correct
this video looks like slowed down compared to other videos
superb
im kinda demotivated to learn further after the release of github copilot
i think you have just explained the first semester of my course in 100 secs
"amazing video well explained 

what is ftp and how it works"
nice now i need it for proxies and reverse proxies 
one thing ive learned from this channel if not everything is that i can do anything
but thats 135 second _
so if a stands for address that must mean aaaa is for aaaaddress
the a record and ns look the same though
future video computer science in 100 seconds

лол я думал тут про магазин днс
its not a recursive resolver its a hybrid resolver
the s sound throughout each video kind of annoying
"fireship just knows when you need something

also please please demystify this dns thingy further"
always high quality videos fireship thanks commenting so the algorithm blesses you sir
finally a fireship video where i already knew what he was explaining 
i like you tone
004 boo for visual accuracy i tried pinging fireshipio and it doesnt resolve the same ip as in the video
"hey jeff thnx for the awesome videos
a 100 seconds of eventloop video would be very cool "

i know how dns works
and i still want to watch this"

is it slowed down or what
i thought im the only one who uses google domains i mean if you can relate godaddy ads 
id love a beyond 100 seconds where you deepdive into how the system actually works and explain topics like doht

more dev ops please this server stuff needs to be demystified
need a subtitle 
will share this with my computer teacher 
amazing
the youtube algorithm explained in 100 seconds
100 seconds of hashing algorithms
see html was designe for managing flowing text automatically   not for placing elements on a screen relative to each other hence the confusion
margin 0 auto  
its not the most difficult its the easiest annoying thing
"easy to do it dynamically too

x  scale  parentsizex  offsetx
y  scale  parentsizey  offsety"
when you put div in a div how does 10 left work
margin auto
why do none of these work all i have is one div where the only css is changing the font and it gets told to center ive tried all of them why 
the only one works with me is the classic one help please
single line code margin auto

you just explained the thing ive struggled with in mimo in under a minute 
thank you
margin auto left the chat
last one mostly i use
i am trying make it since 2 weeks ago thank you my man
thats what i want a 10min video in 30 sec
i cant believe they just added that
what about width 100 margin auto
after 2 years i have the power
you mean were back to tabletrtd for layouts only now disguised as css
you literally saved the life of a web dev 
legend
placeitems center
thanks so much
best shorts mate
yoo im starting in html thx really
if css was a videogame avgn would be all over it the new dr jekyll and mr hyde
this just made my hours of struggle so pointless
i have no problems working on backend but the css partfrontend drives me nuts sometimes 
i love using as many children as possible
so i spent 1 hour trying to center the div just for it to be this simple thats a sign that i need a html and css refresh
thx dude u helped me to land a job
wow has just known the grid method by now
why not margin auto 
"div position absolute
inset 0
"
lo logró 
"css hover effect card

"css hover  drop down menu

015 can anyone explain me why just top50 and left50 is not properly centering it
"margin left auto
margin right auto"
"oh my gahd it was that simple all the time
i had webdev as a class in 7th grade my teachers were cool i guess and i legit suffered hard on that"
"lel there is an easy trick just set the aligncenter and you are done
just like this
div aligncenter
    phello worldp
div"
this should be a psa on why style sheets need to be standardized instead of a tutorial on how to work around it
now center text within a div without using another html element
thank you for proving me wrong it is not an easy task and i am not an idiot
is it 
you saved my time thank you
jesus fokin crist man i fell stupid right now all the time i was flexing before flexing i always had a problem with centering items
that is the single best css tip i have ever read
display block margin auto
"displayflex
and give the child 
marginauto

its that simple"
i still dont know how to do it
htmldiv aligncenter
"for side centering just usde

centercenter"
margin auto
i come back to this video time to time
i would like to nominate this man for a nobel prize
you saved many peoples life with this video
lets goo baby
bro this is the entire reason i lost all hope with css maybe knowing this i will revisit it and try to rekindle our relationship a little lol
i dont think anyone used transform before flexbox i dont think it was even an option i remember using lineheight weirdness
thanks man but ill still be googling how to center a div tomorrow
i remember using javascript to center a div
when you  give up and just use the centercenter tag and take what you can get
yesssssss
i still use flex
marginauto
"margin20px auto
so easy"
bootstrap quit the conversation 
crazy how that one guy couldnt find this online so instead imported a whole other library
"margin 0 auto

the best one"
been looking for the solution for this exact issue lol thx
im still using the first method  since there is no parent to do the other 2
do you even juggle bro
what if it is true then i will start juggle
adderall
"i learned juggling in neurological rehab now i work at meta
one of those sentences is a lie you decide which one"
you could learn to code in the time it takes to juggle
js juggler 
nah bro id rather
html css juggling 
or vice versa
this was literally my first computer science lecture at university ecs401  procedural programming
please do juggling in  seconds video
"next time i go shopping and i take a bunch apples to the checkout and they ask would you like a bag i can finally say

oh no bro i juggle"
wow i learned to juggle a while ago happy to hear its improving my code ability unfortunately i have not noticed the other benefits
lol  i dont think this would make me release stress this would just increase mine  but who knows
bouggusts
can you be serious for once in your life
or vice versa or both
juggling between tutorials
it means jokers can get job at google
comedy
i do both program and juggle with 3 balls and pylons
is that ksi 
if i dont see a juggling for js devs video within the next two months im unsubscribing
is that some new framework 
i am juggling between programming languages  frameworks
are you going to make us an actual video series please
i took a juggling class in college so i def got my moneys worth
so programmingjuggling is only for men since it will make women want to be with you and men to want to be you   
here i am watching this on april fools day
me after watching ill build a juggling game and learn how to play it  win  win 
yeah the real challenge comes when you inevitably start juggling your relationships
i only know how to juggle in balls do you think i can get a career without knowing other juggling languages
anyone else check the publish date on this video and make sure it wasnt april 1
now i am going to learn juggling
i can juggle d all of lifes challenges
learned how to juggle at the age of 5 
i wish this was a joke
programming skill
"alr so i get three balls on hands and i get smart
you dont get to say that much"
i can proof i once juggled at the age of 6 and every women in my contry ran into my house
now hear me out programming while juggling
do yourself a favour and actually read the studies linked in the description
yeah sure disliked unsubscribed
i cant tell i youre being serious or not but maybe ill pull out the juggling sacks
but i just bought a ball and planned to juggle while having my pomodoro break  wtf
oh shit bro good that i learned juggling first 
these shorts are so entertaining it hypes my day up 
oh freak i juggle oranges a lot in the kitchen but im still a dumbbutt maybe im just not doing it right
i get it now its time to stop coding and start juggling instead thank you for opening my eyes
ok i will start to juggle
well that true need a focus
non ironically want to see this course
what is u learned to juggle standard 3 objects within a 2 days
and viceversa 
i dont juggle but i surely could code someone who des it
does being a juggalo count
"did he say relieve stress

aaaaahahahhahahahahahahahahahahahahapoopnuggetskskskskskssk"
you homophobic
"or vice versa

i choked"
or viceversa
by the same logic programming will make you better at juggling no
juggling for javascript aka javascript fatigue
"in coding school

we will now practice ur coding skills juggle 3 balls for 60 seconds"
i coded a juggling app does that count
cool bait
i will be waiting for the course carefully
"actually i code long hours when i am in stress or frustrated 
coding keeps my brain active to ignore problems"
i juggle to become a better programmer
mistyped howtojuggling into youtube and now i wear angry clown makeup
instead do meditation twice a day
the only things im juggling is my balls but as i know you usually juggle three things
juggling for jstf
what about meth
casual misogynistic assumptions
its actually vice vice versa 
"i was with you all the way until the last 5 seconds 

good stuff"
just learn pen tricks that counts as juggling right 
"wanna build an app what language should i learn

firebase juggling"
does karate do the same i hate juggling i cant get by 3  5 rotations ever
im still waiting for the course
"if this were an ad for a paid course i would just say
  shut up and take my money"
time to copy juggling from stackoverflow
hahaha
bro if thats fuckin real lemme juggle real quick
html css and juggle guys remember that
"do you even juggle bro

no i make others jiggle"
women want to be with you or men want to be you thats some poetry right there
if you wanna be better at juggling then learn to code cause coding help you fous which also helps you in juggling
"my resume i am well experienced with html css javascript and juggling 
employer youre hired"
no wonder russians know how to code
"interviewer can you tell me what an ast is
me fireship videoo wtf is an abstract syntax tree  "
" what is an abstract syntax tree
 how many asana tasks are there about asts"
its like his talking nonesense to me
lol ty
for those who are now eager to make their own programming language your next google clues are lexer and parser
you say i dont speak nerd
what da f
my answer i know what it is but if that knowledge is required for this position then i probably dont want to work here
ts is beeeytah
are you interviewing for a compiler writer job
that was cool why dont we code directly in ast or better yet why cant someone build an ast generator for all known languages
do you really need to know it to align some text on a stupid website
still dont know what it is
my rent and grocery prices went up just from seeing this shit
yeah that still meant nothing to me
i still dont get it
finally one thing i already knew
going to ask chatgpt right now
i still dont understand it
music was awesome
what a timing my high schools advanced placement class just started teaching about compilers and this video popped up 
basically html is the true programming language
"interviewer what is ast 
me let me tell you where is it used"
what is the theme you are using
i still did not understand anything you said
i took that class last semester it was such a nightmare of a class
candidates answer if you need this you are 50 years behind industry have a nice day
"interviewer whats an abstract syntax tree
me have a nice day"
thats simple unnecessary
im working on my own programming language at the moment and its compiled making a compiler is a pain in ass 
insane video thank you just understood what im doing making my own language using lisp core functions thank you
the first clip is actual perfect meme 
bro i love you
me a python use what even is a compiler
"recruiter  what is ast 
me "
can i know which code editor this is its so cooland fancy
truly insane timing i just finished a compiler of my own for my regular languages and compilers class how the fuck do you know google
i feel like a shorts class for java would be sick
i dont think you can convey much useful information in a short on this topic except to people who are already skilled and dont need the information
i introduced myself within 10 seconds 
the first video ive come across for system software subject topic
love these videos but research more before you say you know it to the interviewer
niiiiice
please dont give faang anymore weird ideas about making technical interviews even more unnecessary hard than it already is 
so basically json files
did your video get cut
next up treesitter i guess
what is context free grammar im learning compiler construction stuff 
its a superclass of a syntaxtreeimpl
use flex and bison theyre the updated versions of lex and yacc yet another compiler compiler
whats the best ast lib for typescript
literally just finished my compiler assignment for uni its like you can read minds implementing an ast generator for the first time was tough
is this also used in the compile time detection security technique
wow awesome stuff this gave me an insight as to how the compilerstranspilers work under the hood tysm
fun fact ast is the word for branch in german so this thumbnail was very confusing at first 
if only we could turn typescript into machine code
video idea haxe in 100 seconds
the most useful youtube short ever
woo for me it was a good 35sec enligtment
i would be pretty shocked if an interviewer asked this question the questions i ask my interviewees are usually in the form build a x that does y
so simply its json
now i know
germans be like hm
"when i was just getting hot finished nooooooooooooo

jokes apart you explain 6 month of compiler theories better than my professor at college"
so basically it is just syntax
instantly hired
tldr something that you learnt in cs degree but wont ever use unless u ever decided to write a compiler or programming language
wait wot
and theres my entire course in one video
i once built one for config
i cant believe this came after we just finished a course on this
can you do a video on meteor its coming back in 2021 from the dead they got some vc funding to continue development
i dont know either ask to google man 
mind blown
"interview
me let me explain it less than 100 seconds"
yesterday i had dlp test  
java video  next please
i dont think you can understand this video without already knowing a bit about compilers syntax parsers etc
jeff is still my favourite tech youtuber
wow i literally just started learning this in college
antlr in 100 seconds
is he just talked about json or i dont get it 
this is why i wish we had astlexicalaware git
almost creepy how i just googled this days ago
now im curious to check my old projects and see how fkup they were
htmlweb page only
memory leak in javascript o my goodness gotta have pretty low standards to be dealing with this issue
"instruction unclear 
deleted os"
is there something like gccollect in js
now its up to you to fix it 
oh no you csnt escape memory leaks even in js
did that dude just store a lighter under his beast 
garbage collection is every friday with recycling every second friday just have to write that into the logic 
"is your memory leaking
fnf corruption fans quite literally"
"js devs this seems hard to fix
c and c devs hire us we will solve the problem in a minute"
there should be more channels like this one
i reckon if this video was about 15 seconds longer it would have been the most useful video on youtube
can we use this in react native
im just getting started with web development im not sure what most of these shorts mean but i know that im going to need them
noice
its going down what does that mean
hahahahaha just use rust language and compile it to webassembly
just use free on a notepad i do it every hour to free memory
wow this has good knowledge but i lack the intelligence to understand
users at this time why not just write without bugs d
very useful  but how should we release the heap 
you can also see more about the critical rendering path dom cssom on the performance tab
memory leak is just like an angry wife   you cant control it without skills
bro make a video how to sovle thisno video available on youtube on this problem
"its up yo you to fix it
means  aint gonna deal with those garbage"
better dont use javascript at all because its insecure
its the garbage collector for me
mm  well
after laracasts this is the best channel on internet for me
my zen masterhail massa
where do you get these gifs and jpgs the smoking fat guy is an old meme on chinese internet about ten years ago
cool video
thanks bro i was about to call a plumber
how to enable this chart with js heap belowe performance profiler
amaaaaaaaazing
perfectly timed video for my situation at work
"now its up to you to fix it
groans"
love the info but absolutely hate the format please keep short video to tim tok only 
no my diaper is now please change me
in this regard firefox is way better it provides you with nice colorful memory map and you can make snapshots persistent
holy shit out of 10 articles vs 40 second video this is how one should explain short topics wonderful
i didnt even know that was possible with javascript
how to do it for nodejs apps
"me typing tail devzero
linux i dont feel so good"
come for the memes stay for content
is this about my pc or my brainl
cmon man
"now its up to you to fix it

does crying solve the problem"
each of his shorts videos is a piece of art
the more you know melody at the end is chefskiss
can this fix my alzheimers i think i am leaking too much of my memory
blazor in 100 seconds would be interesting to see a replacement for js in the client side
best youtube channel ever 
"you have a memory leak 
solution  dont"
im joe biden and i approve of this muussig messy may stig  you know the thing
thanks
the popeye has fixed two water leakage at once 
right on time i need this like today for an application i am trying to launch
"look up on google how to tell if you have dementia
notice that you already visited all the links
shid the memory is leaking"
an actual important topic and you didnt went all in sadge
wow new super power unlocked
if its not broken dont fix it if its leaking well its leaking
im offended that youtube recommended this video to me
browsers dev tools are so overwhelmingly generous and forgiving that developers take for granted
i miss the dial up connection in the 90s when displaying alert box and frames on web pages were something
this is for client side what is the solution for server side
the beautiful yacht cosmetically afford because trigonometry impressively tease on a obnoxious fiber brawny infamous brian
this topic deserves much more than just 40 secs
a full video on the subject would be interresting d
i was just researching how to identify memory leaks in my react native app when i found this on my feed spooky
love the end lol
"i just buy more memory
im up to 4tb now 





 disclaimer i am just kidding"
does the browser crash 
googleno i dont think i will
medium be like 
if you have a memory leak just hot swap more ram into your pc much easier
did you recorded it on your smartphone 
"it would be very helpful
if you make a slow janky and frozen website and then tought us how to fix it"
i cant see the blue line graph i see a graph with blue background what should i do
what about a webgl game made with js it uses about 600 ram but heap usage only shows 30mb help please
popeye is the true water bender
actually learned something new thank you
a moment of silence for those poor souls who actually needed to fix a memory leak right after this video has ended
instructions unclear patient lost all memories
direct to the point
day 7 asking for a neutralinojs  tauri review 
useless video
"open dreamweaver
paste in script tags

hnnnnnnggg"
this audio is 100 generated by ai
seems fun 
cool i am now copying the source of jquery into dreamweaver in order to create an app for my blackberry thanks for the help d
cant really understand why some people dont like it 
this guy made me like javascript for one moment
just finished jquery and starting react still dont understand anything about react idk maybe im just dumb jquery seemed really straightforward though
the king of js libraries
legend thats the proper way to name it
i really love your voice
he had to copy and paste the j query because a true j query dev doesnt understand how to fetch content without using j query
watching this in 2023
great i can finally write those windows mobile and blackberry os apps
if i know how to print hello world will that guarantee me a developer job
did he say dreamweaver bah
dreamweaver
does this make the site load slower than using plain js and react
i cant wait to watch an episode of doctor stone when they gonna use jquery
dreamweaver killed me 
this is satire right
hey that was more like 150 seconds
almost had me in the first half
so its javascript linq
please do one on c
"omg windows phone and black berry apps
awesome lol"
still using it
my company still use jquery till this day
sold next project of mine will be legendary
i love jquery
this is so cool i am going to start implementing it into open source projects and see the hate messages roll in
if this came out rn it wouldve become the best library
jquery beats complicated modern framework any day of the week and i am tired of pretending it doesnt
i agree jquery was fundational but please remember that theres a reason why we went to declarative frameworks jquery code bases were unmaintainable
041 even as a joke this is going too far
theres nothing better than ajax on jquery
native apps for windows and blackberry  aha 
now i know why my jquery code only works on indexhtml i had to paste it on all pages thank you
"mentioning dreamweaver killed me so hard d
thats exactly how it was back then"
you either die a hero or live long enough to see yourself become the villain
nostalgia
open dreamweaver and paste oh man the nostalgia is real
i hate jquery
umm jr developers  age  15  aight lemme kms
jqueery
people who have spent the last few years refusing to learn anything new are getting awfully defensive in the comment section 
the title of the video jebaited me and i thought it was going to be a the legend of darth plagueis the wise parody with jquery instead
i love that every 100 sec video is at least 2 min
all the people here unironically defending jquery did not get the joke
ah yes jquery one of the few libraries that makes me like javascript
to be real doing something quick and dirty ill just grab jquery great jorb
this reminds me times when i need to make rounded corners using png sprite
me watching this video and i just started learning js last day 
invented before most of todays junior developers were even born my guy how old do you think the average junior dev is 15
base on rich harris words svelte is the return of the write less do more legend 
jquery is really a legend if developer know how to structure your code
it really has to go now
thanks for the tutorial
i miss hide so much
is jquery dead thinking of learning react js
oh man the irony of this video is misleading too much people here d
is jquery still worth using in 2022
" jquery is bloated
 proceed by adding a truckload of js dependencies to work with a modern approach"
if this is all true then why is jquery on the decline
useless video
jquery
040 how to make me not use it
this video is written like it was released on april 1st
i respect jquery respect
bullying jquery is almost as old as php
dreamweaver did we bounce back to 1999
dream weaver almost didnt finish the video and may still unsubscribe
us devs still using it kekkw
welp those who hate jquery are just a bandwagon from react angular vue frameworks lol
jquery in 1 second  dont use it end
pulling up the jquery docs takes me way back
i name my classes as comments
tf2 leaked code is a gold mine of coders lamenting their fate
im not even able to learn this shit why is youtube rubbing it in my face so much
obsolete but might be useful later
your videos keep my interest in coding 
u should mention about comments inheritance in intelij
do you know i have some new friends
the waffle house has found its new host
works except when it doesnt no idea
 chatgpt code untested good luck bro
 copied from git i have no idea bro sry
hdf5 is best file format its self describing
omg jsdoc is a thing 
this video reminds me of the suffering inherent in the code of any valve game
the best coders make it so efficient it looks like black magic even with a comment
well thanks i guess i wont ever be able to use this information in my life tho
no matter how good you are always always write comments
a good programmer can write self explanatory code a great programmer knows not to assume their code is self explanatory
this is the funniest short ive ever seen
my comments be like  hey did you know heartlessangel is a stupid bitch
the longer the overly poetic comments are then the code stands out more
im glad we got rid of jsdoc in our typescript code base so much clutter
"public

 move component
void movecomponent

w why"
commit made changes
 i was drunk when i wrote this i have no idea how it works or even why
your teammates dont want to know what your code does they want to know why its breaking the build
so basically elons comments
youre humour is brilliant
wait i actually want to know how to write selfdescribing code that doesnt require comments
"the ending comment for those of you who are
curious

1 atthis point f
read more"
you comment because your employer expects the next employee to be able to maintain the code
comment just above an empty parameterless constructor returns this
reminds me of the tf2 code
"yesterday i rewrote some guys code then today i saw what i changed i basically did same thing with one minor difference dd 
time well spent"
clean code tells you otherwise if you need to write comments you failed as a coder and software architect
dont delete this it doesnt seem to do anything but if its removed it breaks everything
"i imagine some kids going

 why are you using  for coments"
nah man that aint no code no more thats a book
psd gives him ptsd
the only comments i have is the xml commentation
dont touch it it works
"if i read a docstring starting like
this is a function that 
my pocket knife pops open "
sorry but uf the code is complicated commenting what a certain section does is very useful if you have to look back on it some time in the future
 this is bad
semantics semantics
curious here whats wrong with psd 
this is a comment
my code is so funny that no comments are needed
txt is the best file format
 dear future me good luck
every time i write a funny comment in the codebase it gets flagged for removal in the peer reviews because god forbid we have fun
sick burn 
i try to write self documenting code and use comments for the clever bits
it is very fascinating how psd is a boon for a designer but an absolute nightmare for a developer
so wait if you do write code like if user_status_isonline then displayuserstatusonline where its so obvious what it doesdo you need comments or no
my code is self documenting and other lies you can tell yourself
"code says what program does
comment says when where who what why how
artificial language cannot compete with natural language"
i add comments if something hacky happening and also if im copying code from the internet i add link to whatever stackoverflow i did ise
ngl tho i kinda do over comment stuff for my college activities as for my actual personal projects zero
 printf please sorry for your self 
i just write black magic stuff boogaloo thing or a series of curses to remind me that the codeblock is buggy or needs to be done later
 todo this is dumb
then theres me who comments the code and leaves a comment on why that line doesnt work 
multi line comments are a thing so you dont gotta use  for every line
"what to use comments on

to actually segment your files to allow efficient skimming

higher level logic implementation"
i usually just comment dont even try to understand what this shit is before my code
" i was high as fuck when i wrote this
 i have no idea what it does
 but if i remove this line everything crashes"
nobody wants to know me even compiler ignores me
 this is so overenginered this is fucking stupid
oh this is great
helps people learn too
great information
do you have a paid version of this that goes deeper into detail
thank you very muchhhhhhhhhhhh
terraform in 137 seconds
159 shots fired
great video thank you for sharing 
i was just asking about how all the companies handle the resources in the cloud lol terraform just solved this problem got my inner peace back
025 how do you reproduce the same thing in the future  most cloud providers allows for exporting configurations why is that not good enough
how about infrastructureascode videos on ansible please 
your gift is cheweing information for us to swallow it easily ew
sweet  crisp thanks 
thank you this was an awesome intro to terraform
everything in 100 seconds ships to hi mom  lol
pulumi in 100 seconds plz
thank you very helpful
once your startup has failed
can you make a video on ansible as well 8
can you do one for ansible thanks
nice and short explanation thanks
beautiful explanation
i want more terraform videos if youre interested in making them love your stuff
so no one here gonna talk about the gif at 020
good video short and straight to the point in 100 secs
what about ansible is 100 second  
how does this man has so much knowledge 
i love you
simply awesome intro
dude writes hii mom wherever he can
once your startup has failed the life of every developer in 1 sentence
jeff is my favourite tech youtuber
018 progression of a standard tech career
can you do nomad in 100 sec
nice video explaining the quick overview of what terraform is
018 wtf 
fireship is on fire
the best
what would i do without yall you should just write everyones docs for now on  so perfect and to the point
too nice man keep it up 
this was really helpful  thanks can you please do istio
why no azure icon at the start of the video 
no love for azure feelsbadman
can we get 100 seconds of dom manipulation please
i wish i have seen this a few weeks ago thats cool thanks for the great video again love your short and well explained videos
full course pls for pro members ofc
the background music is very annoying me please change it
now open telemetry
complete course for this 
wouldnt it be solved if there was an exportimport in the gui
nice extension
yml in 100 seconds and beyond
hey fireship lets go about yarn package managet
whats the style used for the bash terminal
102 docker is not a cloud provider maybe you wanted to put digital ocean there
"awesome

would anyone recommend pulumi over terraform"
ansible chef cloudformation opswork too much confusion
"017
 just small 1 problem 

just 1 problem small

hmmmmm"
so its a gui to avoid the command line and code and now code and a cli to simplify the gui 
is there any platform where i could get to know about latest release pumping in market fast like this one please do suggest
hey jeff id you could maybe topics on service workers or golang
can you do emberjs in 100 seconds
this form of videos are great thank you so much
200 baby 
cherrafom
"great video as always
please do go in 100 seconds next"
aws cdk reacted haha
a gsap 100s tutorial
day 15 asking for a neutralinojs tauri review 
once your startup has failed lol
pulumi is better
how did i miss this
amazing which are your vscode terminal snipped by the way it looks beautiful
do one on pulumi look you know terraform well same but it works and its easy plus its code haha
"the point of gui was to replace cli
now we are evolving just backwards"
cool a way to programatically get a 50k bill
event sourcing in 100s please
serverless framework in 100 seconds
please make go in 100 seconds d
how it is different from aws cloudformation
no matter how complicated the subject is you make it easy best guy in youtube 
just getting started with aws this sounds like a pretty interesting tool
please create your vs code environment video including all extensions and settings
this is an old typescript trick ive used for years but its just as easy in vanilla js i just updated the nextjs course to use it 
this was actually insanely useful information
hey youtube give me more contents like this
just use clojure
awesome game changer
bro recorded this in his moms basement 
is it safe to push to prod 
how do the same for python
does this also work with c headers
lovely want more of these
bro you save me in 24 seconds
i just watched your video about typescript magic literal
"yooo
your a gem bruh"
this is nice
or you can just add an index file to export all the identifiers you want from a directory
im going to cry this is amazing
wow just another reason to hate javascripts existence
does it work with webpack
its not working in tsconfig sometimes it shows the path when we mouse hover but when we start the server it doesnt
now gonna wake up at 3am to put it on my project before i forget
this is only for typescript
or cmd  control  space to import something
maybe just typescript but lead with xyz where  is the app root
ayo thanks dude this gonna change my life
if you created your app with createreactapp then this approach may not work apparently
awesome
dude u actually saved my life with this one thank you so much 
oh my god you have officially changed my little coding life forever
this is so cool
tell me again why i love fireship
thats real handy
thanks a lot
this is great yeah im also commenting because algorithm
you changed my life
no way why tf did i not know this omg
what do you use lib for  im curious
instead of writing out the path you could also just right click on the file or folder click copy relative path and just paste it
omg thats what that means this has changed my life forever
that shouldnt be a setting for your editor your editor should figure that out from what ever bundler youre using
what if i use another editor
this literally changed my mind i wish to sue youtube for not recommending this earlier and recover my hours wasted as damages
ok but how do i get intellisense to respect those paths as well
same issue with php
need more of these shorts
tried with a react native project but seems to not work while using relative paths in nested directories
seriously where has this been all my life
this doesnt work in a typescript or react native project  anyone knows the solution
does this work with other languages like php or c
this is so good
why are you calling this a va code trick it has nothing to do with vs code
bro ur a freaking beast u have no idea what u have done for me thank brother
awesome tip
commenting so the yt algorithm knows this is what i need in my life
but you need to remember all the alias and vscode cannot autocomplete the better solution is baseurl
saw this a long while ago but completely forgot about it made a new project yesterday and it is so helpful
and go to definition will not working
did not work for a nextjs project any help
what icons are you using
one thing that sucks about javascript development is javascript development
does this only work in vscode or is it something i can do in other editors and ides like sublime emacs vim
i really like your videos 
i have no idea what this man is saying but i like his voice
i dont know js but im going to start after im done with my css course and this seems useful so ill save it
thanks a lot this really helped me out
awesome 
i am a newbie but this vid makes me feels like i am a pro loooolll
you just saved me crazy react path tracing 
its not a problem i thought you know better
that seinfeld meme
mind  blown
got to use this thank you
woah new learning good thing i subscribed
what to do this works with babel
"one thing that sucks about javascript development
it exists"
youre a god 
you changed my life
what is the theme used in vscode is video
pwoli
dont forget about autoimports
aaaaannnd you made it again time to refactor some repositories
does it work in non next js project
wow so simple yet beautiful hack thanks
ans whent you work on a linux host you wont know how to go used with out vscod3  xc
as funny as that is actually that second suggestion is pretty fire i think for certain situations
just define a function logmessage if processenvnode_envproduction  consolelogmessage
the will ferrell cutscene was perfect 
fck y we using debugger keyword to see step by step each code processing
have a boolean var debug write a function that returns debug  consolelogmsg turn debug off on production
its why i like debugwriteline in c once you mark your build as release its stripped out by the compiler never will end up in the production build
why not just use the debugger on vs code  not sure how it works but its way better than console logging
why would you use console logs in production
"as a js developer
poor soul"
me a beginner wait im not supposed to use consolelog
does it work with client side javascript 
just learned about logpoints will be using forevermore
i just realized that i left some consolelogs in the production of my latest project nice
"worries about shame can also be eased with consoledebug
output does not show by default in the console one has to have verbose level enabled"
669thcommenter
or write unit tests
i dont know programming is there two ways to print to console and one of them is bad
or simply use something like terser to drop alla console logs when bundling for production
rookout is great
i dont even know what you mean by run it in a debugger
me who is using neovim
nerds making fun of nerds man i just stick to consoleloh
please work  
good tips i saved it thanks
even better let c  consolelog stdoutwrite
javascript developer isnt that already embarrassing
"use alert
easy"
as an end user id actually like logs to be there sometimes theres some logic error in a site and id like to know if its my fault network app etc
using useful tools  bad
"or you can replace consolelog to c
const c  consolelog 
chi mom
chi mom

 hi mom
hi mom"
nobodys shaming anybody for using consolelog who are these people that you made up
"as java script developers
you are the plague of the earth"
fuck vs code
wouldnt this vs code log start bothering at some point and you wouldnt be able to find where it is
"console logs are absolutely fine
deal with it"
hey bud easy fix use different ide lol 
well if youre just writing random debugging crap to the standard output its functionally the same
why its shaming 
so the reason to not do it is to avoid being bullied by other programmers bro do these nerds not remember high school ill stuff them in a locker
take a look at spatie ray its awesome for debugging
"just one question though  about not using consolelog







why the fuck not"
i prefer to write a wrapper around console log that will disregard the message if its run in production
i think i will just continue to not care about stupid people who shame others 
just that those only work when the code is running in vscode which it usually wont be when youre writing a frontend application
the instructions are not clear i have uninstalled vscode and opened paint
just use nodejs 
solution dont use javascript use c 
vs code the true code hero
"in conclusion do extra step
this video needs extra dislike"
logpoints dont seem to work i can not see the messages in console
yeahhh but setting up the vscode debugger is a hassle every time you feel me
what is a breakpoint
i remember finding debugger
as javascript devs we print random things to the console to debug me as a python and java developer theyre the same picture
how do u run in debugger 
i can write a function where which will only log if processenvnode_env is development
"i use 
consolelog     
on top of html if there is production environment is defined "
"me i hate when i forget to remove all my console logs before deploying

vscode i can make them invisible for you

"
is that available in jetbrains ides
just make sure you dont have any console logs during code review
just use python
i just added webpack plugin to remove logs from production and set eslint to warn
maybe start to use chrome debugger  breakpoints
wow im definitely going to use log points
i am often too lazy to setup the vsc debugger
in very complex webpack configurations it could be hard to get the debugger working
its something very special
yea ill stick to console log
100 true but im just hitting on my keyboard and get smth like djdkdi
consolelog shaming men get more ridiculous every day
why is it bad tho who decided that its bad why would you push a code with console log into a prod lmao
i like to leave consolelog easter eggs in my code for developers to find if they open the console
i usually create a function that says print
but console helps in cloudwatch to view logs
best thing is write console log wrapper classfunction  and ignore log logic in prod
console log is fine to be honest
hope visual studio also has this
see it again
"who cares about people using console log if your code works it works 

imagine being a debugging snob"
what a waste
this is great and all but i usually just pay adderall addicts to know this stuff for me
the worst part about learning to code the gatekeepers
what about people who dont use vscode
 session layer explanation was awesome 
great
031 u mean smtp
still dont get it
youre able to explain the osi model in 100secs better than any school for hours or years 
"haha

not the session layer"
i love you
one of the few tech videostutorials that doesnt have a narration that makes you go to sleep thank you for this
i love the background music  may u put the name of that comment below
this channel is amazing
very interesting
jeff is still my favourite tech youtuber
did taco bell really sponsor this video or was that just another nostalgic reference 
whats the song used in the background
cant believe how good this is
thanks now i am ready for the interview xd
030 smpt lol
next video  kali linux in 100 seconds 
during my professional life i have worked on application session network data link and physical layers 
thanks please make a video explain each layer jejeje 
ruby on rails in 100 seconds 
just in some 8 minutes i became a full stack dev thanks to this 100 sec videos 
this was not your finest video master coder average technician syndrome p
could you make a video on ansible
waitlayer 4 network or layer 3 network
this is better than my whole semester of computer networks in college
seriously admiring your efforts to make the video so knowledgedense undoubtedly boon to the community 
could you also do a jpgjpeg svg png googles web etc popular image files in 100 seconds p 
i love the smpt protocol
can you do a vuedart vs vue
now you need a cisco routing course in 100 seconds
somehow jeff managed to summarize my entire networking i uni course in 100 seconds
finally jeff got a sponsor
docker volumes in 100 seconds
could you do a guide on sequelize
interesting weve always learned and discussed the osi model bottomup
we love this serie keep it up my man 
050  i see what u did there

please make one for oauth2
for someone who wants not 100 seconds video but several hours long course i recommend to watch this video 
i noticed s m p t
bgm please
"mispronounce smtp
you said smpt
like my comment and force him to reupload video "
hugo and angular
plz do 100 sec of microprocessors 100 sec of dbms 100 sec of data structures and 100 sec of algorithms we are confident that you will not fail us
but taco bell doesnt have 7layer burritos anymore
and you studied this as a whole subject  here it is on youtube for 100 seconds
he said smpt
talk about foreshadowing
my network is a certificate just got emailed to me right after i passed it with your video lol great work simple clear and concise list
"nope that doesnt work you even didnt show the numbers of layers 

too little info to consider this video a useful one"
"awesome video
my college professors taking 1 week to explain this model and you only just 100 seconds"
that was a quick word
wow that 100 sec helped me more than 1 year in school
please make a fulllength or extralength video on this
"pwas in 100 seconds
or
websockets in 100 seconds"
was that steve balmer selling taco bell at the end
good one
"hi jeff fireship
happy birthday to your 2nd son crew timothy"
oh my goodness i just searched for this today its extremely informative things i learnt in the uni all came back to me in a better way
jeff did you just say smpt instead of smtp 
could you please do an angular video anything will do
140 jeff being a cyborg confirmed
i havent learned this in my entire semester but now it just fits in my mind like a breeze
"teacher  computer networking is a 6 months course



jeff  100 secs take it or leave it"
ip is level 3 not 4
top notch
better than my teacher explanation
socket io in 100 secs please
032 i hate to be that guy but did he say smpt
title should be  welcome to networking 101 1 semester of comsci tick
031 smpt  smtp
seriously you covered almost everything thank you
damn are we going towards network now especially cisco
032 you said smpt i think you meant smtp
please do not throw salami pizza awaythis sentence was very helpful during exams
please make a video on github and its tips and tricks
030 hehe
i was thinking about getting to learn more about networkingthanks
you are awesome 
actually i love the 100 s videos more than anything in the world
lol i cannot tell if this is a tech video or an snl skit
bem and css architechture please
can you make a longer video on this its amazing
except that the osi model in no way represents the actual network stack
a great start for understanding what we call the layer 8 errors
i use ngrok to play minecraft lan with my boys
i use tmole now pretty short command to write just tmole 3000 and done
finally i understand what tf is ngrok
come again
ill just use zerotier thank you very much
i have been wanting this for years 0
really helpful
bro this is actually really helpful
yo this is cool
holy fuck
i waa expecting firebase 
i just put it on discord pages its free
bro but it works only for 1hr or 2hrs only
didnt know that
why you never write hi dad
bro ive been watching this video for like a year to get the tunneling
can we use this as a permanent way to host a website
they need to add bookmarks in shorts mane
f commenting again because i just tried out to test it on my mern stack app and it works like butter  thank you
tell me this is true 
this is one of those things that every developer should know
github pages
oh my god
why not just use tor
what about security how do i know its safe
the url at the end
i really like localxpose for that usecase
informative
i want to change my localhost 300 into a live server how do i do that
my college website just got easier
ngrok is great even lets you host your own minecraft server if your router isnt equipped for it
"130kb js for hi mom

"
you didnt know this 
this guy really loves his mom
githuh laughs from the corner
can this work on a minecraft server
you can forward the port on your router and it will be visible from other computers not very secure but gets the job done
i try it  i enter to my server
if you enter from the this server in to this server is localhost
i prefer github
this just makes darker web pages easier for kids to get into
where do i download
better use linux and iptables
just port forward through your router bro this is just more bloat
youtube should add the feature to save shorts i want to save it but i cant
you can also use docker
ngrok or cloudflare which one is easier
well color me purple because i didnt know thats what ngrok did i heard it mentioned 1 time and i didnt even know what it was until now
you should make a ngrok in 100 seconds
xampp 
"i want to host my php website 
can anyone suggest best and cheap hosting service"
github also has port forwarding in github codespaces
just use ipfs
how much can you keep it running
what to select im confused
i feel like shit after seeing this
how did it bring me to my site
nice thumbnail 
this guy is just stackoverflow but in person
you just solved a decade old problem i had with my minecraft server thank you i can rest in peace
yggdrasil i2p or the slowpoke tor
and this is how the fishing journey begins 
what is the point of building a website when youre not putting it on a real server
localtunnel is awesome npx localtunnel port6969 subdomainnotshady
why dont use hot hub host
you can get ssltls certificates for free
this reminds me of minecraft servers back when i didnt know shit and wondered why some weird app was needed to play minecraft with my friends
just port forward and use noip to get temporary url
wowwwwww awesome
i personally use github pages
cool info glad i subbed
github
i desperately want to save shorts to playlists
pagekite too
the waffle house has found its new host
back in the days i used hamachie to do the exact same thing for my minecraft server
this is very important especially for solo developers who dont have the money to purchase web hosts to test their site
is it free
replit be like
as far i remember pwas work over localhost too 
or for a full fledged website use gh pages
i camt get it to work it makes me enter a domain on the website but i dont have one
im bad at this but i thought you can add to github and your friend can see it later
i have always used hamachi
just create a docker image
got something useful for today after randomly roaming around youtube
omg i remember i used ngrok in like 5th grade for a minecraft server at camp lmao
wow this is very useful
excellent but ngrok can be very dangerous  so be careful guys
thats odd your app at localhost3000 looks a lot like my shitty app
youre basically just writing go code then
"const data err  a thendata  data nullcatcherr  null err
maybe write a wrapper that returns the updated promise"
so youre telling me that its basically rust
better a few trycatches one by one rather than nested
just use expressasynchandler  to not to write some many code
or do await promiseallpromise1 promise2
right js doesnt bubble up errors from functions would have made this a lot easier
i fuckin needed this holy shit tysm
what about just use 1 await and all data is called in a callback function or function after success
or use either from fpts
cant you put all awaits in one try catch
this is golang style
it feels sort of like an either monad awesome tip thanks
destructuring the tuple is not typescriptfriendly normally i would wrap data and error into an obj
or called as the either monad in fp convention
just use golang at this point
this case promiseall is better
how to create rust from scratch
you just reinvented golanggo if err null
bro even invented monad
how to engineer js to golang
lets write golang in js
almost starts to look like elixir error handling
i seriously do not understand why go style error handling has become so popular its objectively bug prone and inefficient
a monad correct me if i am wrong
this is literally what golang does lol
or just use rust
interesting to see manually implementing pcall from lua in js
or you could just use go
what about promiseallsettled  
and were coming full circle
my guy basically created result type
bro just let your apis return error statements that are relevant to each case problem solved
the worlds moving too fast
new languaje jsgo
never do that way method should not handle his own errors this breaks correct error responsibility paradigma you teach bad coding
rust does it better
or like just use monads instead of this ad hoc spaghetti thats not enforced by the runtime
is this some js joke that i am too rust to understand
so now i have to write code that checks whether there was an error after ich call which you conveniently left out
that looks somewhat similar to how monads work
why not make sure you leave async calls to the boundary of the code nice pipelined code
топ хех ага ага круто вот да да да дах да хех ага ага ага ага ана ага ага ага ага
топчик топ ребята и извиняюсь за спам ну да ладно ничего страшного думаю не будет же ну да ладно хех ага ага
классно
топ объяснил хех круто хех ага ага
класс
they still execute synchronously though
would you look at that maybe golang was right by not having exceptions d
writing code is easy writing code that works is hard writing good code that is maintainable and easy to read that works may the lord guide you
async is made synchronous code but with more steps
that intro tho
zoomers invented monads
please can someone explain to me why use an arrays instead of an object to handle data and error isnt it better with an object
monads to the rescue
remind me in a week
thats what idiomatic go does by default check it out
totally recommend snipttmonads library to assist with the pattern demonstrated in this video
or chain a few then with a error handler
why not throw de error and treat it on a error handler or something this if error will just be the same as the try catchs or catchs
me using unwrap 
which font are him using in this video
i will name this as goscript
rxjs subscribe
question what about def those can stack pretty easily
async backrooms
so implementing a result structure
theres a library called awaittojs that does that but its absolutely better implement it by our own thanks 
bringing golang error handling to javascript 
it would be nice to have something like  rusts errorpropagating  here
if you use promiseallseatled
"nicuuu
thanks"
damn youtube needs add the feature of saving shorts to a playlist i need this for later hah
and what you just replaced try catch with if else
this is literally go lol
hey guy i didnt learn javascript to handle no damn errors i only handle my business
that js looks a little rusty
you attack go for its error handling and now you give the very same error handling solution for js
you just made js into go
or better yet use monads
thats awesome
didnt rust kinda fixed this with 
the waffle house has found its new host
god i hate programming
the waffle house has found its new host
focus on css pseudoclasses next 
is this still relevant
its a really great explanation thank you very much 3
great content dude thank you so much
thanks
never done drugs but your 100 sec series are like little lines of coke i like to do before really diving into a subject lmao

coolest way of teaching
really great videos
its so surprising how you get to understand something in just 100s
"thank you this been always a doubt even after watching 4 or 5 other tutorials
you made it quite a capsule form "
now this is cool
114 this actually makes react app faster especially for thousands of items

firefox has scrollbarwidth scrollbarheight and scrollbarcolor to change the appearance of any scrollbar on any element
this dude needs a raise
respect man i always learn so much in those 100 seconds it reminds me of flutter widget videos and i love both
__proto__  and prototype in 100s
i really love your content youre one of the only people who can make enjoyable videos about programming and not bore everyone to death keep it up
just to be clear dont do this in real life
you got hitman of javascript 
genius
clean hit
we need a tutorial on this
same here but i did not injected poison pill   and the client still did not paid i asked for 20usd
i did something  similar in video game i made for a sus client
now what if you dont have access to the website because your client banned it from you
i think you shouldnt name the file poisonjs
absolute bullshit lol youd hack their deployment account and replace it with your own repo or hack their git
is this really possible the opacity thing
imagine if your website provider changes your ip all your pills will be poisonous xd
man i dont get tired to say this but ur content is pure gold 4 real
can you shows us how to do it 
that is so cool
bahahaha 
did you find him and  kill him
this is why cops and right wing hate tech lol we circumvent the law and they hate it lol
tutorial  for edu puporuous
so basically css did the killer stuff
how u create an api for  checking payment status
my nigga
use an escrow next time
100 days is to much it would be better if it was 10
genius
thats a cool trick i like that
where would you store the script to avoid the client accessing it and modifying it 
i would love to see the api fields bunch of normal fields then clientpaid 0 
this is perfect you are a genius
legend 
100 do this in real life if people are too shitty to pay you for your work they cant have the goods
ill take things that never happened for 100
i would have also accepted paded or paided
i wish this would be available for image format
clients probably gonna hate you but haters gonna hate ayyy lmao
cool hac ker
giving fireship a whole new meaning
the client was taken away
i should learn this code
website looks bad either way
and overseas entities are also putting in backdoors sometimes right into the hardware biiig deal no surprise here
just add ads that pay you lol
this is awesome just a small mod have it do a crossfade with my park or suspended account page when the opacity is around 90
deactivate js
very interesting
ill show you a trick thermonuclear warhead incoming
3 months without paying though thats quite a long time id do 25 a day giving them a little over a month
nah set it to take 02
lol i have long learned you never fuck with programmers
you have incredible patience for this i wouldve had that opacity down to 0 in 2 days
this is genius
cant the client just remove the poison part of the code
chmod 000 or redirect to your site
that is a beautiful website
this actually happend irl 
always make an easter egg to prove you are the one who built it
nobody here gonna talk about that web 30 website he showed at the beginning thats the funniest part of the bit cracked me up
"dont do this in real life
me its too late"
what did you make that website in 1999
"javascript easy to disable no
if he doesnt code chatgpt for do it for free"
laughs in opacity1 important
how is the script checking you bill acc this loook like bolox
i actually did this a month ago they paid when it was on 03 opacity 
dark side welcomes you
i built this beautiful website picturing the most generic web page on the planet
always get at least 50 up front and the rest when job is complete if the client has bad rep then up front 100 before any work is done
just dont make a contract no laws hurt
being a freelancer means having 2 full time jobs at once the task you hire yourself out for and not getting ripped off by clients
genius
"alters the source code
well thats better"
you even gave 100 days of buffer time to clients to pay you clearly a gentleman 
the client is ur dad
very professional even if the intentions are good you will never be trusted due to the milicious conduct
this mf is a stubborn guy and i love it
listen we were going to pay you but you said you didnt accept ious so we were out of ideas
dude who would pay for that the website look like it was from 1996
did he pay you
wow imagine getting a car but each day the brakes get worse and worse because you didnt pay
thats smart i wouldve made the bodys max width  and max height  1 every day
you will give me the code right now or ill find you in real life
their company is autorun prestige av
yep got same problem unpaid by numerous companies go figure
runs reliably haha good one

so docker is basically a freaking vm why would anyone want experience with that what else i need experience with using a pen
thanks for this unbelievable content
amazing stuff
now i undestand
when i tell people about docker i just say its fucking magic and if they have any notions of what docker is they will agree
podman
what does it mean only operating system is virtualized i still dont know what is the difference between virtual machine and docker
thank you
amazing in 100 seconds 
perfectly explained
steam proton in 100 seconds
i highly appreciate the content you provided without doing any nonsense i saw your video first time and i am loving it  love from indiaaaa

great job mate 
i was expecting hi mom in the message
oy where do you guys learn specialized languages like these from
we use docker at work so we can use ubuntu and i dont really understand what it is  it just works thanks for this video
"clean experience
always fresh developer channel 
impressive fast knowledge "
great video about to add docker to my resume kubernetes next
do podman next
dude i love your channel thanks for all the videos 3
i like that when he says the word faster he shows a video of a running cheetah and for slow he shows a fat cat going through the pet door 
docker is probably the most lifechanging tool ive used in my life so far it makes deployment as easy as running it locally
without the voiceover this video looks purer and better
basic 
now do kubernetes hahahaha
amazing explanation sir
this series is genius request vagrant in a 100 seconds

just a fantastic fat kitty video inlay for the separate os instances  very funny
can i say i love you
"a lot of respect for you
you explain very well"
thanks fireship interviewer asked me what is docker i explained what is explained in this video
would love to see helm in 100 seconds
kubernetes in 100 seconds  please
i liked all your tutorials but on this one i have to give you dislike because of the thumbnail i hope you got my point
i failed so badly to teach the interns and you guys make it in 100 sec
wtf is the matter the background musiclike fck go easy on the music man
could you plrease reduce the music volume for heavensake
i didnt know john mulaney had a youtube channel
best damm video i have seen on docker by far i wish all tutorial videos were like this
what text font are you using it looks very clean
this saves our time
your videos are really amazing can you share how you edit the contents its really amazing

why did you put the music like seriously what goes through peoples heads
front end dom updating php 
bro wtf this is the best shit out there
its a good choice for small projects
theres a translation error in the spanish name
lol can use templates instead of fighting with javascript functions
we are moving from next to svelte
seems really cool
is there any way not to use svelte file extension it is way too long adding components is not enjoyable it should be 3 letters or less
my primary go to channel now thanks alot for amazing stuff
svelte feels as the way htlm should have natively always been
its 131 seconds not 100
best framework so far for me
all 3 in one page pass
"it look very easy and fast
but you didnt said who made it"
korean translation title slim in 100 seconds
this is the video that encouraged me to use svelte in my projects from then i never had to look back you have my thanks yet again
how about making the app seo friendly  svelte is it hard
going to try and build something for this devember
best thing about svelte no react tech bros
its a shame that this amazing tool isnt popular enough to get a job
how is this any different from vue 3
watching your videos is like compressed thought like a zip file it takes unpacking i love it
please create a full svelte course and a full sveltekit firebase course 
i was able to deploy my personal webpage in three hours using sveltetailwind without prior knowledge 
this is perhaps the greatest video on ui programming i have seen so far thanks
wow its so mobxish looks like i found an ideal frontend framework to play with
so its php but with js
i will continue using php and javascript
this one just falls between vue and react
hi could svelte help in building data heavy scalable applications
iiiiiiiiii wanna see a full scale svelte  firebase lesson set like the angular one but super up to date  pleeeeeeeeease 
idk if i am crazy or is state of fe just running in circle xd
this looks actual fun to use
now lets start 100h journey learing svelte
thank you
stencil js 100 sec pls
svelte is 
what about vue3  composition api looks the same it has also the setup attr for script and behaves almost like svelte  u need to use ref
thanks for the video i liked how you were concise and emphasized how svelte differs from other frameworks
brother make a video with spring boot  web framework 
looks great i felt that i continued to use vue with it
rails in 100s
gonna learn this
i like it because its simple
should i i dont know ditch everything i learned in react and start from scratch in svelete 
100 seconds of markojs
next solids please 
its pretty similar to vue i will give it a try
has no one seen vue so much of this is similar
thanks
declarative my ass
"that is the
 only framework that as a backend developer who dislikes frontend i enjoy to use"
very similar to blazor but blazor is in c
"the only thing preventing me from using it is the name
idk its so startupish"
looks awesome cant wait to try
i love svelte 
svelte is the best  svelte for all 
as a react dev i really wished svelte supported jsx  i dont wanna learn derivatives 
i probably wouldnt say its the only framework thats nice to use it looks very similar to vue
please is there a frame work like prisma that is for php if yes please do a video about it i really appreciate your work
thanks
what is the font you use in these videos
svelte native in 100 seconds please
100 second of xstate 
so its basically vue with some extra steps 
really enjoying your content  can you please make a video on svelte native  most ppl dont even seem to be aware of its fortunate existence
laravel in 100 seconds please
never tried but it looks simple organicif it makes any sense logical and fun to work with
the only js framework that dont make me to puke
sounds good to use
finally something not as complex as angular or something that does not support mac like react
where are the hooks
i hope one day this becomes as popular as react i hate the mainstream frameworks
аххахаха перевод название видео станьте стройнее за сто секунд
jsx ftw
this is very similar to vue though no
anyone knows a good place to learn svelte
react is already out dated in few years there will be no more react even facebook changing thier code base to sevelte
with this one video i have already mastered svelte and placed as svelte  developer for better salary than react and angular dev  tx man
i was using reactjs till now but now i tried svelte and it felt very good
is there a way to run a function on input change in svelte instead of bindchange that only change an variavle value
the ad is longer than 100s ffs

is that easy to learn im kinda lazy
thank you
kindly make a video on fastapi
the advertisements before your videos are longer than your video
why arent this videos on youtube shorts yet
ultimate explanation in shot period
brother i highly believe that u will make a video soon about cassandra vs redis
"crypto full stack devs be like
react  redis  stacks  bitcoin"
loved the video quick and to the point  just as i like it 3
redis  key value store cache
just switched to neo4j didnt know redis supported cypher _
great video but this was not 100 seconds closer to 2 minutes and 25 seconds
wow i was about to integrate redis into my stack to speed up mongodb but now im thinking of dropping the mongodb part
first glass intro
great
could you do brightscript
these kind of videos are what i need when i have to install software as prerequisites for a project and i want to know what they are
you can store relational databases in memory too just got to pay for that 1tb of ram aaaaand youre now fired for racking up the aws bill
that 127 gif of flash is a little bit sus xddddddddd
redis in 136 seconds
as a computer science student i start from your channel whenever i have to study a different topic thanks for the excellent short content
i want to make a youtube channel like one
correct will use it becouse its fast and easy to use
thank you for telling us nice redis in 100 seconds
please do not use redis as your primary db persistence in redis is done in a best effort manner sort of like a backup but you can still lose data
nats in 100 sec please awesome series 
what is hyperlog anyone
this is the best first approach someone can get to more in depth knowledge
nice straight forward no nonsense video thanks a lot for these
redis is still somehow one of the most underrated tools on the web
not as a main database but yes as a session storage
thanks for this amazing video sir
redis graph replacing rdbms is what i seek please do a video on it
boom so redis can help you get and set data as fast as possible
you should do rethinkdb
best fucking explanation ive seen on redis for a very long time
"i use it i dont understand it 
didnt understand it from this video neither"
be honest even with just 100 seconds we all stopped the video before the ending and before he was done talking
how is this different from firebase realtime database
weibo interesting
c in 100 seconds
redis cloud is cheaper than firebase 
коротко вичерпно і по суті
id like to see a video on etcd not only is it a powerful keyvalue store but understanding how it uses the raft algorithm in a cluster is amazing
didnt know therere addons on it thanks
in the last 5 years redis has grown pretty neat did relational redis on application level with lua scripting on redis in 2015 using a php app 
please make a 100 secount video about elastic search 
these short videos are very addictive
and here my university teaches mysql 
i play at 075 speed and i understand 
wouldnt this require a lot of memory can you configure it to only cache some tables in memory or something similar
que need a beyond video
i tried to use redis as my primary database with probably 10k sustained write  and read  seconds it crashed
innodb gang
is redisgraph acid then does it still only store on the disk periodically versus right away whats the situation with any potential data loss
google sheet with sheet api  google script is the only database im ever going to use
say you are old without mentioning your age memcached  redis
we need something like a redis enterprise but open source the usual enterprise pricing is too expensive
a primary db will require acidcompliance and relational model then again pg and mysql are still hard to beat in many scenarios
good video 
this is awesome very informative
now im ready for an interview 
a huge jump from the old days of memcache sigh
got an email from redis lab today featuring this video
i think for it to be used as a primary database it should use more than one threads
didnt know about it supporting graph cypher thing wow
32 nodejs web apps replicas with their own redis and a single redis master this is fast
can we setup redis json redis other modules ourselves on a server
i probably wouldnt because it solves problems that i dont have
have been using redis for queue tasks without knowing all of this  thanks for letting me know this 3
vs cassandra in speed
i thought redis was a messaging queue service like mqtt
my answer hell no unless i wouldnt mind loosing 60 seconds worth of user data during a server crash or blackout or something
fantastic gonna use it on my next project
"i would use redis as primary database in some cases but also not in some other cases
it really just depends on the needs for me"
it was going really well until it can be used as your primarly database
but if i restart server all data will be lost
always a great 100sec explanation
reduce it adds things 
this os trash  teaching  but good  editing though
please check  using array reduce method to count frequency of elements  
explain reduce in the shortest time 
not me needing to put it on 075 because im slow af 
reducers are so useful once you got the concept you can do really great things with them
"fireship explains the reduce method in depth in 100 seconds
also fireship tries to explain all of react in 100 seconds"
excellent description thank you
good video sure but all that empty lines
i finally understand
is this less efficient than a for loop
i learned this by brute force lmao used it until i understood
thanks
here where it comes from 
hmmm fold
it is like producing items
which is readable and simple the forloop use the forloop
this wouldnt work with an array of a million numbers
1111  hoezaay
personally i wouldnt choose reduce over simple loop for such use cases
reduce reuse  ecyc e
the correct result should have been 42
did you start shift pitching your newer videos lol
thank you fireship for providing your vs code theme and font in the video description
please tell me the name of the song i know it from somewhere and ive been looking for it for months please tell
javascript is so weird
of course i will see u in the next video
fireship is the type of channel whose video ill like before watching thanks
100 secondes videos are the best thing happend on youtube
my lord thank you for making this ive always been confused about reduce it turns out i didnt even know what it did
fireship  is reduceright faster than reduce similar to negative for loops being faster due to how memory works
does anyone know the extension for the emojis he uses
arraysort in 100sec 
vscode color theme 
the only thing i am able to do in 100 secs is ejecuate uh i meam 10 secs
"for the order total problem which would you go for
a
  const total  ordersmapo  ototalreducea b  a  b
b
  const total  ordersreduceacc o  acc  ototal"
bricks are apparently more expensive
id love to learn about your console setup i like it outputs right in there
"rule of searching for good tutorials
check if the video was posted by fireship or traversy media d"
does javascript not have a sum function for arrays like python does for lists
"this is very helpful
thank you really for this short this clear explanation"
which theme you are using in vs code by the i loved the video
mejor que los videos de 30min
doing a quick google search shows that the reduce approach performs slower than the simple loop approach on many occasions any comment on this
more please 
and what are the benefits of array reduce
try sorting  filter array in 100sec
so cool
how to write emojis in the code like it is done at second 29
even the ads are longer than the video
try multithreading in 100 seconds
that helped me as a java developer too thanks
hi jeff how long will the sale for the pro membership be on for
i am liking this 100s 
can you like get something to stop your ss from cutting in to my ears jesus
"hi could you share please what software do you use for video edit animations graphic thx

ps i mean just for this video"
suppose i have 2 keys amount and total and i want sum to both columns so how i can i write this in reduce functions
foldr
do recursion in 100sec
what a good explanation thank you so much
js generators next please 
this is so nice  thank you
reduceright shouldve been called reduceleft
bink and you will miss it
love this format
you should do 200 seconds so i can comprehend what is actually going on in the video
for the love of satan please make more of these type of videos i neeeedddd itttttt
this series is gold
reduceright wow never heard of it
thank you very informative
is this just about the same thing as foldl and foldr in haskell
as someone that uses js alot these are nice videos to help other people understand js nice job d
reduce documentation reduced to 100 seconds
amazing
generators in 100 sec
yea im just gonna stick with my for loop for now  why change something that already works and pretty much totally explains itself
this series is eye opening
been working with js for a while and never really got the reduce method thanks
thank you so much for this iv always struggled to understand reduce till now
i love how you show the vanilla for loop in comparison that gives complete context for reduce
these are great
so its fold
amazing 
the disadvantage of reduceright is that it also flips the order of the indexes
talking to a girl in 100 secs
event queue in 100 secs
try rxjs in 100sec
esmodules in 100 seconds
wow very effective video 
nice description in a short time
i wrote a ton of perl code in the late 90s into the early 2000s i used it on web sites in system administration and in bioinformatics projects
im here because dustin moskovitz learned this in 3 days with the book perl for dummies
wow this language is shit
"our variable
communism intensified"
java on drugs
as much as i love perl because idk it just seems to be easier to do things in it autivivication does sound like necromancy
thanks now im a perl expert
i think perl is super underrated
i hate perl and i had to deal with it in my first job to fix bugs left behind by developers who had left the company it was awful
this is actually a better intro to perl than most perl books
my brain feels like i just finished a calculus lecture
its definitely time to break out emacs
can you talk about delphi next
not enough 
when i first met perl i got a veeeery painful headache just by reading the code 
i like perl because it is a great gateway to learning c
sometimes i need a refresher when programming this is the channel for that
anyone who writes unreadable perl obv doesnt know how to really write perl time to find another argument nerds
its accurate to compare perl to voodoo magic
my favourite language
"i used a lot of perl in the early 2000 to automate stuff like data importation for sap 

but in the end i ended up replacing it with python"
wow  amazing video  thank you  is there an easygood ide for perl under linux  im trying to work with an existing code suite
to feel more like a human language than a machine language  meanwhile  133
yes i definitely want a language that has necromancy as a core feature
great video again anyway when you want to prove your programming language of choice syntax is not that bad just put it next to perl code easy win
regex
"aside from the use strict thing one important thing i feel was missed was the fat comma used mostly in hashes

my hash  hello  1 world  2"
112 comrade perl
uhmm introverted language
my variable our variable soviet anthem plays
brightscript in 100 seconds
"please check your syntax
126
133"
the my our and unless are good ideas you dont need to know them but the moment you put your eyes on them you know what they mean
i havent used perl for 20 years  back in the heady days of when it was the next big thing i think i need to relearn it
its dead golang too use java or python or php or swift
the great thing about perl is that its easy to write fast and remarkably useful larry wall and his descendants did a great job
114 ussr anthem intensifies
whats about rust in 100 seconds
the fact that no one uses perl makes it more cool
"i dont like perl 
that is all"
i feel like i missed something
"designed perl to feel more like a human language than a computer language

perl "
i will list perl on my resumé in the skills section as opposed to listing masochism in the hobbies section because fittingly that is more terse
im waiting for the day when theres only single programming language for everything yes its python
more perl please expecially in bioinf field
perl in 100 secs wheres the references wheres the modules and packages love perl the most underrated and misunderstood language
ugly and awkward are we talking about perl or perl programmers
041 you meant cursed not turse
perl is likely the most powerful tool in my toolbox
remember 93 of paint splatters are valid perl programs
like  subscribe  hahahahaha
say what you will about perl i enjoy the feature that enables a monthly dump truck full of money to show up at my house
im still perl programmer 
could you please do a video about powershell
talk about ocaml please
this reminds me of prolog
at 059 how do i get those create file and other buttons on my atom

could you do json files in 100 seconds i still dont understand them
010 who designed it to be a more human readable language  proceed to evolve into one of the most unreadable
what do you use to write your code
113 soviet anthem plays
really love your work man
did you make a sequel about merge conflicts yet
i love the analogies  i usually hate analogies 
nice sequel
rails in 100 second
i shouldnt have watched this not knowing anything about git
"i still doesnt understand git and im too afraid to try on working project

i do understand how to use tortoisegit"
i still dont know what a repository is
nvidia should be tried for unfair profit and hoarding
amazing  liked and subbed
great overview
linus singlehandedly changed the internet and no one can tell me differently
"man i learnt git yesterday only and started using it 
im loving it "
i use git everyday as a dev still watched and enjoyed this your videos are pretty great also the delorean just that
if you could do a git explained in 10 seconds or less that would be ideal  jk thanks for the quality content
man this channel is legendary for breaking down overwhelming concepts though git might not be the best example it can be confusing
my head
these videos are freaking amazing very well made and very addictive
loki should really watch this video
i just learned git im adding it to my resume thanks
cool video
it all makes sense now
great video 
i find it better than crash course
i like this background soundtrack and image just came back to hear it keep making these more please thank you
you should consider to create complete courses
this helped
no one tell me how to actually go back in time its just possible
python in 100 secconds
did he ever make the sequel 
theres a new command called git switch which makes it worthwhile to rerecord this video
what happened to merge conflict in 100 seconds 
pretty nice for a short video
when i saw the title no way
please explaine more about git
dart in 100 sec
this tutorial is great to understand the mechanics behind git 
why no one talk about how can remove files from existing repo is this holy
amazing this channel is awesome
me single dev has merge conflicts
vs code is becoming the de facto code editor congratulations satya
this is such a well made video its short but really explains the basics keep it up
vhs logo attracted me and then watching your videos i became pretty sure you will cross millions subscribers sooner than you think
"you earned a subscriber and i am really thankful to you for creating this amazing video well done

your new fan"
git rebase in 100 seconds pls
how do i pick the repo version i want to go back to
its fun only if you know already about it
i still dont get git 
what  to do after  git commit m any name
like shotgun info shot awesome
great format love it
git gud at explaining quicker
great explanation of git 
why are you merging a feature branch without a rebase _
read git vs fossil git is for huge projects with huge teams its complicated and easy to damage thats a good enough reason to use rcs cvs or fossil
can you do nwjs
linus was the real mvp
this is far from git explained well at least complete git have sooooo much more than this
wow great series i believe these videos arent as easy as it seems i highly appreciate your efforts thanks again 
"programmers  no one can explain git so quickly 

fireship hold my stopwatch"
i wish i could make videos like this
awesome
shoutout to linus for making this amazing technology for us to use
man i love how you explain and the quality of the videos even if theyre 100 sec long
another video regarding merging  plssssss
"you can also create a branch and then switch to it using one command
git checkout b featurex"
lovely 3 the best git explanation i have ever seen
awesome video 
i just discovered your channel and i already fell in love with it 3
"the most interactive educational channel you could possibly find 
subscribed"
haha thats right guys if you hit 223 file conflict on a merge  specially rebase  just wait for the sequel 
my sticker hasnt been here since ive submitted the git tutorial you provided 2 years ago 
more more more yeah yeah
i watched this video yesterday and git is taught in class today are you a sage
why downloading git is soo slow getting speed of 3kb
jeff can you create an indepth video or tutorial about git
excellent explanation man 
you forgot to explain cherrypick  fetch checkout and many more things
js vs python in 100 sec next 
this video is multipurpose everything you said also applies to mercurial and subversion
you are a living legend bro
100s clip is fantastic but you dont cover the entire spectrum and that sucks
thank you so much for your work
how do you create such high quality videos so often very cool
got rebase
"if you know gender draw some random pixel art for that human

nice"
i prefer the basic generic avatar is less invasive
this is how they make nfts
i like that the concept of generating a random avatar is too hard
"how do you program something like this you dont there is a tool that already did all the hard work for you

webdev in a nutshell"
ive never thought this is a good practice everyone gets the same default unless they go in and add an avatar
thanks bro i was looking for this for sometime
interesting thanks may god bless
idk why but this userspecific default avatars really annoy me
nobodys going to talk about the shape of the third generated pixel art image
no the lettered default pfps are the worst
nah dog im not gonna get arrested for hatespeech cuz a wrong avatar for wrong gender race and etc
"for someone who thinks dicebear is too fat
robohash"
worth watching ur shorts
"i was thinking about this and my solution is too painful

use ml models for image generation"
i mean i prefer to represent myself with a ripoff microsoft logo i created in pixlr but to each their own
holy fuck this is great
nice bro thanks for sharing this
open source free gendered avatars no thanks lmao
this sounds like what you do when you code but youre not smart enough to make money as a programmer
i cant seem to figure out how to assign gender in dicebear 
the waffle house has found its new host
me using stable diffusion to generate my avatar
how can i save this avatars in db using nodejs 
know gender  that would require an ai nowadays and even if the ai would work people would still find a way to call you or the ai transphobic
i like the github method best
there are free apis for that
this is wonderful website it really bring colors to my project thank you
next is to star the repo else you might forget when you need it
youre not special and you should not feel special you will receive the same gray image with a silhouette and you will not be allowed to change it
fast way to getting sued for discrimination
what about midjourney
tried it a white man got an avatar of black man gets upset and unsigns
remember gravatar me neither
i love these shorts
ive been using this for a while its awesome
i never liked these avatars they are still unpersonal and kitschy in my opinion
the way of water
okay soni dont need to write this myself but on the other hand i feel the urge to write it myself
i instantly thought about being cancelled when providing only male and female pics lol
randomly generated generates pp
how does discord generate different characters to a few new users and a default profile picture to the rest of the new users
uzerair
perfect timing
now i know what inspired nft artists though their stuff doesnt even fit as a good pfp
or you basically use ai to create random images
dont forget gravatar
awesome
dicebear is awesome
what specific name of this pattern in pixel art im not talking about human pixel art
average nft bro
bro just exposed the entire nft art industry
literally nft generators
its not a mistake  its a masterpiece
tried posting a comment about the similarity between this and nfts its now gone thanks youtube
sounds like nfts if you ask me
did you just assume pixel gender
"how do you code this
 fire thats the neat part you dont"
nft pfp 
tbh i hate these cause tgey make you stand out
nfts in a nutshell
looooop
is this how nfts are made lmao
dang these news nfts be looking sick
literally free nft generator
congratulations the nft dogs are already on it
or implement gravatar
nft generator
my trillion dollar plan to flood the nft market is going well
everyone ganster till you make an account and the profile pic is already a photo of you
avatars nft generator
just use nfts
all i see are nfts
free nft
micah is that a trap
you can now sell these and call them nfts lmao
how nfts are made
i wonder if it can steal nft
nft be like
"so basically

you get a free nft"
that was my name at the end lol got caught off guard by that
this is how nfts are made
i would much prefer the static prof pic and just add my own
nft maker
picrews but for 12 year olds instead of groomers on twitter
no just give them all hulk hogan holding spaghetti
thats my name
"take their name
add a bunch of random letters
thats the seed"
gross bro stop with the the nonsense
but asians still do
alan turing had absolutely no right to be so handsome 
write a script so every time you are on stack overflow you cant see the votes
wasnt there a 19th century woman who contributed to the development of the automated machine like a math genius google it
tell us about the babbage machine and ada lovelace bruv
turing tarpits are fun
"people got sick of doing math by hand
in 1 more year you wont even have to do it by brain "
in emulation yes i can sit down and read assembly from a turning complete machine and perform the operations myself
and we still learning this shit in collegebut why
magic the gathering is turing complete
rip alan turing i get sad everytime i hear hus name
turing was gay
alright hear me out
ask css to make a random number
you can write loops in html  css
im not turing complete then
is powerpoint without macros of course turing complete
does does what
you can with magic the gathering cards
you might suck at math but youre damn good at psychology
real question now would alan turing have passed the turing test
does what
btw this doesnt seem like a normal idea its an inevitable idea
html5 technically contains javascript  but yes html and css without javascript is turing complete
i will assume doom has already been implemented in html5css
i am making a dumb programming language and now you tell me i need to check this shit frick
anyone else just randomly started watching shorts and now its an everyday thing 
imagine computers today if the turing that caught on was anything except true or false in a straight line 
even powerpoint is turing complete look it up on yt
then he turned out to be gay and was killed
excel is turing complete
wait when did html  css get turing complete
turings story is so sad bro just liked other bros and the uk tortured him till he killed himself he saved millions and thats how he was treated
also turing was gay
well there have been couple machines and programs before
how does html and css run loops
powerpoint is turing complete
dude stop ending the videos like right after you start a new sentence now im like html and css what
a guy named alun turing cracked the enigma code that helped turn the tide of ww2 yeah just some guy 
when i heard this thing i instantly thought of brainf
still dont get how that works or runs computers or games or anything
a calculator is turing complete because fractran is turing complete
what about the power loom  its turing complete
magic the gathering is turing complete
im self taught and this video made me understand for loops better
my calculator probably can
can turings machine divide by zero
friking magic the gathering is turing complete
"reference
i mean it makes sense but for the people who want more"
i think you need to include more than just ones and zeros on the tape for it to be turing complete
just because html and css are turing complete doesnt mean its feasible to build anything meaningful with only them
this sounds similar to the programming language brainfuck
spineless tagless gmachine in 100 seconds when
power point is turing complete
what does html and css do
and we will never know
your scientists where so focused on thinking whether or not they could they did not stop and realize it they should
graphing pocket calculators are turingcomplete
brainfuck just chilling because it is a digital turing machine
"computation isnt math
i thought you were gonna say alkhwarizmi or something like that"
are you gay
actually how with html and css
my guy looks like granit xhaka
can someone explain about that html and css part
mechanical computers existed way before turing
next linux kernel written in html  css
i can simulate a turing machine ez
so html is not turing complete without a stylesheet 
is the brain turing complete
"this is the only channel that i watched yet understand nothing 
am i the only one"
minecraft redstone is turing complete
exel is turing complete
"yah dwarf fortress too
and minecraft and power point and even doom"
030 my ti84 would like  you to know  it is it can even play tetris
time to do some scripting in html
html and css doesnt what mf
love how quickly the video ends at the last sentence
"infinite literally 
reirregardless"
fun fact the card game magic the gathering is actually turing compleat
the ending will trigger so many people i guess
bro you forgot about calc
youtube shorts keep ending early and i cant tell if its the creator or youtube
what application is that on the right at 009
классное видео
black baron its exhausting 
amazing video
does it mean that software testing job is in danger
what do you mean by is not like engineering something easy like a bridge
i would love to see your video about test driven development tdd as well it is great topic to touch
bridge building is easy ridiculous software development is so much more easier than building a bridge
clearly zero research about software testing was done to create content for this video
you are the best 
came for the tech stayed for the jokes i dont catch until about 5 seconds later
yo how to setup wsl2  cypress
quantom physics xd
please do a video on dgraph 
half of the conventions mentioned in the video are only used in frontend development and specifically for typescript development
"135
function adda b
return a  b"
microservices in 100seconds and a short video if possible
tailwind css in 100 seconds
oh yeah the thing 100 of shitty companies dont do i see
016 small step missing the v8 engine compiles into bytecode first which then is compiled into machine code
is this the job of software dev engineer in test who is solely responsible on just testing stuffs
thank you so much
speaking as someone stuck in manual testing right now i felt the bit about jira ticket backlogs in my blood
lol building a bridge takes a lot more work than releasing buggy software that could later be fixed
oh my fireship i am ticking yes to the karma options on create newwebapp shell for sure in next chance
"testing and development

this is the video ive been waiting for looking forward to the longerformat one
thanks man take love 3
easylike a bridge
testing is easy thats when i run my server and it breaks right
ahh i know how it feels to write thousand e2e tests for testing every combination of data
this is great cant wait for ruby on rails in 100 seconds 
yessss testing
i really like that people are aware of quantum physics in computer 016
software architecture in 100 seconds
easy as bridge someone who use to be an architect designing hospital and now design and develop appsi can say they both have complexities lol 
omg i cant wait for that tdd video

"code testing in one sentence

self cannibalising your code so that your customers dont"
so it all starts with quantum physics
what is this test youre talking about our testers are our clients no need to hire manual testers
"beyond 100 seconds writing your tester
beyond 600 seconds wiriting a tester for your tester"
" fireship testing 

my brain is ready "
any building engineer would be heavily offended by that intro
i like how the iceberg diagram says ecmascript for javascript lol
do redis in 100s
accessibility testing and development
make tailwind css in 100 seconds good video btw
its just a joke your teachers would never lie to you subscribe if you like code
guys this video is ai generated
theres probably a universe where the primary colors are mahogany xanadu and chartreuse
how does this work with the color wheel is red and green still complimentary colors
me as an artist who tries ro explain this literally everytine to my colleagues and they still say that ittens color wheel is the one
the one piece i was missing the whole time was additive vs subtractive light nice
yes it was issac newton who fell on the apple
how can i change my computer screen to render rgbym please
what is the difference between ryb and cmy
yesterday i argued with my 5 year old that the primary colors were rgb
the apple was blue
my school told me it was red blue and green
i was taught this but i somehow knew i had to go against it and i did or maybe i just liked green and hated yellow lol
dislike unsubscribe a misleading and disrespectful video on several levels
so no lie in the end
ive never heard red green and yellow being primary colors
they did none of those things but im not from the us so idk
apple didnt fell newtons head just accelerated into it
holly sheet
the waffle house has found its new host
but that looked more a really zoomed in crt matrix
not the apple  nooooooooo
my half life was a
"well damn my kindergarten teacher was a lying ho 

cant believe she didnt teach me about additive and subtractive colors in my phone pixels"
isaac newton fell on an apple and thats how he discovered applesauce
color science is a deep rabbit hole and it requires a human observer specifically our eyes and their rods n cones
additive and subtractive color theories are different and work in a different medium based on the sum function
youre over simplifying something way more complicated
why red green and blue paint together dont make white paint
last one really hitted  me
"b 1 200

its just a joke your teachers would never lie t
you subscribe if you like code"
red blue and green
"if the apple falls does the moon also fall   
poof
calculus and motion of falling objects have joined the meeting"
this is a lie you literally say one is subtractive the other is additive and cmykb is the print standard painters would use primaries
what about hsv hue saturation value
pantone hold my beer
what  school teaches u these things
why not use subtractive colors
the primary colors are red green blue yellow cyan and magenta rgybcm stay in school
but you still didnt explain why rby is taught as the primary colours
facts if cymk is also a light mixing cyan yellow magĝnta makes white or black in lights
but if you mix cyan magenta and yellow it turns into blue green and red that makes black  edit blue mixes with red then makes  magenta again
rby isnt a set of primary colours and it annoys me that is taught in school
you even lesics bro
magenta cyan and somewhat yellow dont have colors
eye conesrods they correspond best to the peaks our eyes actually use to determine color
no rby
why did god decide to make colors so difficult
whaaaat they taught us that yellow was a primary color i am just learning i learnt that 0
i was never taught rby wtf
okay but why are pigments different
red blue and yellow have something to do with paint
because without rgb we cant have rgb fans and stripes for more fps in video games
i think theres a difference between pigment and ink because one is more transparent
did they lie or did they not please make up your mind
actually in india rgb are taught as the primary colours so maybe my teachers werent liars 
wrong ryb are the primary colors because you cannot create them out of other colors cmyk only simulates the color spectrum read a book for once
rgb is best
we were wondering about that a couple weeks ago now i know thanks
"newton  at 23 ive discovered a new property of light
me at 23 i wonder if the guys at jackass could use another jackass"
bro u should start a fireship short youtube channel i think that will be better to organize your videos
i actually didnt learn the primary colors in kindergarten i learned it in 1st grade
now i see why printers use subtractive
its not a mistake  its a masterpiece
thank you for sharing the truth about this people dont seem to care when i talk about this
"rgb are primary light colors
primary colors in general are ryb"
so comments are more explanatory than shorts
then when we bypass your eyes and put images directly into your brain your teachers will be right again
studied this in my computer graphics class last semester
okay primary bla bla bla its all good but apple falling on newtowns head was a lie
i only clicked because i wanted to know what the hell rby is
"why does computers use rgb

decides to not tell you"
nice video it might be a basic concept but i keep completely forgetting why theyre different
also theres nothing fundamental about primary colors they are just a way to trick our eyes into seeing different colors
i dont remember kindergarten what the hell are they teaching kids the primary colors are cmy for any uses of pigment
i was never taught about any of this 
if you declare with your mouth jesus is lord and believe in your heart that god raised him from the deadyou will be saved romans109
wait in school i learned about this its the additive and subtractive theory of colour i also knew the apple being a lie from my physics teacher
wtf is this video too much changing colors too quickly youre trying to give me an epileptic seizure jk but damn that is disorientating
thank youuu i get annoyed to no end when people refuse to listen to reason about such a simple subject
they do  use  yellow blue and red 
its not a lie it is one of the two types of primary colors
is it really called big iron  whauow i can have 750 day as consultant in any other area true that i like cobol somehow
it was built over 100 years ago in 1959  
cobol the fifth language i used in my career after assembler rpg fortran and pl1  what a clunker it was
im guessing those companies that still keep this zombie language alive will need to start recruiting by seance in the next few years
if you want to fail just call ilboabno
in the end he tries to run the code not the binary what a lame
ah memories
thank you c  
arent you lucky you were not a cs graduate in 1959
i damned near think i learned cobol now
the modern cobol is java 
"008 dinosaur mainframes  having a system with legacy does not make it a dinosaur
ibm z16 telum  stop parroting the false infos"
its too bad they didnt have enough memory to have millions of reserved words i am curious how far they would have gone with endless resources
i think american airlines are still using cobol to process boarding passes it says smoke  no by the seating assignment
i took that is 12th grade in berkeley ca in 1974 ill buy 10 computers for a million alex
the 72 character limit is also so that you can print your code out on 80 column dot matrix printers
tell us you cant math without oh nevermind
you sir have crashed and burned 1959 was not over 100 years ago please have someone review your content
yes i coded in cobol 35 years ago i hated it at first but soon was smitten by its sensual allure ha ha naw it always sucked
stupidest language introduction ever
it was developed over 100 years ago in 1959 yeah well yeah
this video is so full of horse crap
i actually found very fun to work with cobol two years ago its a great language that still is evolving maybe slowly than others
did you calculate how long ago it was developed in cobol
it was developed over 100 years ago in 1959   really  100 years ago
i honestly dont understand why anybody would hate cobol i truly enjoyed my years as a cobol  cics programmer
cobalts metal hard and shining cobols wordy and confining
or naturalanother ibm language
developed over 100 years ago in 1959
im gonna crash the bank with knowledge in cobol
adding up and taking away obviously wasnt your strong point
i took a cobol programming class in high school in 1979 i never used it in real life
funniest video ive watched today 
the language was developed 100 years ago in 1959 its 2023 i was born in 1960 and im not 99 years old 64 years ago not 100
if god wanted us to use cobol he wouldve given us a different  environment  
in 1972 i learned cobol bal and rpg
developed over 100yrs ago in 1959  huh
the best kind of dry humor
i loved cobal even learned it using punchcards
fascinating thank you
72 columns so it fits on punch cards and so its functional on your mobile devicecracked me up
i hope im no alone in saying cobol sucks
今でもcobolでコーディングされた基幹系システムは相当あるでしょうね金融機関の事務所理系とかこれですしね
140  sixfigures per what  s
well 1959 is no a hundred year ago yet
it was developed over 100 years ago in 1959  boy that is a flabby language
"it only64 yrs old 
not even eligible for ss"
there was only one cobol program that was ever written  every other cobol program was just a modified version of it  the same is also true of jcl
over 100 years ago in 1959 wow you are good at mathing
wanna take a shot at os400 on the as400 i had a very brief exposure to it around the year 2000
"142
did you even fix the error dafaq"
did a bunch of cobol in the 80s and 90s mixed with sql it was not that bad actually
"120 responsive on mobile devices
can you show us an example of this"
did this at university only thing from my degree i have never found a use for
"it was developed 100 years ago
math has left the chat"
best comedy movie of 2020 2021
this is fucking hilarious on so many levels
i love how all it does is throw a bunch of errors
1959 is more than 100 years ago
object oriented nah how about business oriented
the sarcasm in this video is priceless written over 100 years ago in 1959 
"over 100 years ago

1959

am i missing something"
or as we used to call itcrowbar
142 bruh it didnt even work
how was 1959 over 100 years ago in the year 2020
this is dated cobol programming these restrictions are optional
cobol is the b52 of programming languages
im pretty sure you are the only reason i keep learning to code
great videos i understand storybook from this video much easier than its own official docs
what was the tool used to show the component tree
instead of just writing the components and get the job done now we have more jobs to do wasting time on an another extra layer
its great idea
this video is worth gold
this is so much better than reading their landing page
create things like this instead of new js framework donut
my love is like a storybook love its as real as the feelings i feel
well thanks 
100 seconds of qwik next please
lgtm  lets get that mread

it would be nice to see the process of making an npm component library from start to finish great video
overkill
i think its ui is really bad my company tried to use it i never felt compeled to check it out it got abandoned
i used to be a frontend dev and then switched to backend i kinda miss that now
can we have elm in 100 seconds
partytown in 100 seconds
thanks i thought storybook was some kind of cms haha now i can actually understand it
this is the first video you have ever made that gave me 0 understanding of what the thing youre talking about actually is
jittery video what is this 24 fps
video says 4k but aint no way thats 4k
seems intersting
we use it but its a biiig hassle and terrible documentation
you are using apex legends music
next do vagrant in 100 seconds
2 years from now we will need a framework to manage storybooks
playwright in 100 seconds would be interesting
i am planning to build my tech blog stack using svelte and firebase and styling it using bulma is there any more better stack no reactjs please
anything that generates documentation which can be altered in realtime on frontend 
the only thing i have against this tool is that i cant get it running under any of mine vite based projects there i need to use ladle
vue svelte and soon dear lord is there another hot new framework ive missed soon in 100 seconds please 
great video please consider doing a more deepdive into storybook as well i still find it hard to figure out how to do more complex things
most of the time he is speaking the language of gods
we want pointers in 100 seconds
thank you very informative 
excellent 
we kind of only use storybook for its storyshots snapshot testing feature could have worth to mention even in 100 secs 
what about flutter apps 
logo nya kaya simontok wkwkwk
does anyone know what that r website is with old windows 95 ui components
whats the difference between nginx and express
does nginx have a lot of patches i need a server with lots of patches a patchy server if you will can nginx satisfy my requirements
haproxy in 100 seconds mr fireship
was that a freakazoid reference
just visiting to watch old jeff who doent talk about ai
the real question is why the hell is it pronounced enginex ive been pronouncing it njinx my entire life
this vid alone earned a subscribe
apache in 100 seconds
ada tokopedia coy
amazing crash course in 100 sec
what is proper path for www  in this example it is appwww which is unknown to me  is varwww good for avoiding permissions issues
thanks just needed to know how to pronounce it to not sound stupid in a meeting in few minutes when im about to lie i used it before
for us it can be read as nginks take the nasal ng in ring and then inks 
i wish i would have watched this before setting this up with documentation alone
i prefer to use cloudflares cloudflared it uses cloudflare so u dont have to worry about ddos attacks either
adding nginx to my resume
this is awesome
"nginx node js and docker
you can also use kubernetes ansible terraform openstack
if you want to automate and create biggg company"
this is too short
сделайте видео о том как вывести плейлист m3u8 в youtube   оно выйдет в топ и наберёт миллионы просмотров а это видео ни о чём
please make 100 sec video on apache also
what about cloudflare
interest please let  know ahead of ti
saeee hahahah you just have to play with the daw and you gaing experience slowly
ok so how could someone use this knowledge for anonymity
still dont get what is reverse proxy
this shit down rn lmao apache ftw
excellent
n jinx or nyinks
can i see your face man
automatically delicious gets to the meat and potaoes dont forget the beans thank you for hard work put in
why didnt you say who made it
oh so its not pronounced njinks
hi mom
i use this for kali linux and web development thanks
сысоев красава прославился даже по телеку на английском рассказали
ive heard people call it niginx which seemed weird
set play back to 2x and learn in 50 sec
"so quick so informative
thanks"
man thank you really helped big time
what is the difference between nginx and express js are they comparable or is this an apple and orange type of comparison
what is the difference between nginx and express js are they comparable or is this an apple and orange type of comparison
i feel that the video didnt go into enough depth
a bit complex to grasp but at least i have an idea of what nginx is now
"ok boys lets all pretend we understood everything he said in one go
1
2
3"
so ngnix is an alternative to appache right
besides website nginx can also be used for email server and video streaming server using rtmp  ffmpeg
whats the name of the bg music you used in this video
502 bad gateway moment
041  instead of   yet another case of doslexia
what the hell 8s nginx now sometimes i wonder do this tech list ever end
do api6 in 100 seconds
great video would really appreciate a longer video on this one as well
that fucking 100 second video just randomly answered a question that three hours of google and stack overflow failed to answer ggwp
ive always read it njinx lol
thanks man
apache2 is better
was this video done with react code 
awesome
really good quality
i am used to putting configuration files in usrlocalnginxconf
nice can you please do a video on objectivec
could you do a video on apache
this wont stop me from calling it njinx
enginex thats how you pronounce it all this time ive been saying nginxee 
i wish i could go away from apache but its so much easier to use with php
and i thought it was only useful for making my minecraft server public
105 seconds including whatever ads show before the video
you should check out caddy
i love nginx sooo much one of the best pieces of software out there really cool
freakazoid
but whats the use
omg freakazoid ftw
make one about traefik
next openlitespeed hehe
always love the quality thank you
most videos i watch on 2x speed  fireship videos i sometimes have to slow to 75x  love the quality content  second on these videos
please  make  django in 100 seconds
thank you buddy
i hate you this is too short couldnt understand anything
i dont get the difference of it why cant i use express and appget or post to handle my http requests
can anyone tell me where i can learn all this in more detail
if 200 seconds it will can more understand than this lol 
"damn this is like the matrix 
 me i wanna fly an helicopter  
 operator there you go how to fly an helicopter in 100 seconds 

done"
the person who created this video is possibly a big fan of freakazoid hi mom
i dont like to learn new stuff but your way of teaching makes it addictive to watch and watch the next vid great work thanks
django in 100 secs
just wanted to say thank you so much for your vids
we need how to use it inside google cloud
please make a video about caddy i thibk not enough people know about it
apache in 100 seconds next
good content my friend keep it up
caddy in 100 seconds please
disgusting fingernail
we produce it every 3 days 1000 of those is all storage of humans so 3000 days of data what
i have made a zip bomb that unextract to the teeny tiny size of 554 yottabyte
hard to know 1 zettabyte each 3 days from where only in cloud the backups are included and the replicas can be way more or way less than that imo
all that bytes still 5gbps bandwidth
i heard yadda bite
still not enough to contain my skyrim mods folder
i dont think it is enough for my homeworks folder
thats a lot of nudes
whatever
now hear me out now how many dic pi
im boutta make a 1000 yottabyte zip bomb and blow up the cia database lol
enough to store my friends schoolworkhomework folder
quettabyte is bigger than a yottabyte its wayyy bigger than a yottabyte yottabyte is weak compared to a quettabyte
thats a yotta bytes
thats a yotta data
"make a 55 yottabyte zip bomb
shut down the entire internet"
2 yottabyte zip bomb exists btw
we are finally getting close enough to take a picture of your mom
and thats still not enough memory to print a photo if your mum
zip bomb
and theres a zip bomb the size of 55 of them
your math doesnt check out 1zb is 3 days of human activity then 1yb is all human activity i guess weve only lived for 3000 years
isnt the amount of data generated by humans for 3 days multiplied by 1000 is just the data generated for 3000 days
can it fit my music playlist
actually you have to multiply it by 1024x
did he just say 1 yottabyte is enough to hold all the information we have after saying we produce one in about 3000 days which is less than 10 years
these names getting funnier what next yombexbyte
i want to yoddabite of storage
1 every 3 days but a thousand of those is more then weve ever created i call bull
wow thats a yotta bytes
still not big enough for my rock picture collection
if one zettabyte could be stored with human activity every 3 days then surely a yottabyte could only be 3000 days right
kids in 2800 omg dad you got me the new iphone 639 wait this is the 10 yottabyte i told you  i wanted the 24 one
"finally


enough to store my hentai and yiff collection"
"and a thousand of those is a brontobyte

i think i heard this somewhere dont know if thats true tho"
so its 200 000 photos  10004
when the police find the 4 yottabytes of feet pics
finally something to contain my homework folder 
and if you are so unlocky to discover a rubiks cube with a gothic motif in a basement somewhere and solve one of its solutions you get cinobites
are they metric now i thought they were powers of 2
its 1024 to the next grouping
the dawn of man was 3000 days ago
well someone made a zip file with with a yottabyte apparently  probably fake but damn
of we produce 1zb of information every 3 days how come we only need 1000x to store all the information produced umtil now
bro geobyte is also there
thats cool but can it run chrome
and after that im off to get a littlebite 
something doesnt add up if we make a zettabyte every 3 days then in 3000 days well have the yottabyte and the internet is much older than 9 years
one day the entire earth will be a server for the galaxy
so your saying a yotta bite can store all man made creations but 1000th of it is made every 3 days
so the person that owns bytes makes how much with a penny per byte byte me
what i found most peculiar is we produce at least a 1000th of all human knowledge available each 3 days
warzone would still take up all the space
this is why theyve been experimenting with biological based storage using proteins and fungi potentially endless energy efficient storage
need me some yoda bites
humans create 1 zettabyte every 3days 1 yottabyte can hold all data ever created thus we can conclude humans have lived for 3000 days
so every 3 days is 1 zettabyte and 1000 zettabytes is a yottabyte  so how can 1 yottabyte store all of humanity if its only 3000 days worth or smth
and 1024 yottabytes is an brontobyte
and still not enough data for my homework folder
multiply a yottabyte by 1000 and you have what i am now trading marking as a harambyte
i just wanna load into a rockstar server 
how much is a tasty bite
i need a lotta yotta bytes
so all human history was in 3000 days i am confusement
by the end of the decade a pdophile will be arrested with that much porn on his computer theyre always hoarding cp like smaug and his gold
thats a yotta information
next year 1terabyte ssd can only store 1 game
when you realize that the selfie at the start of the video is photoshopped 
zettabyte ever three days yottabyte over thousands of years confusion
one virus all tat gone
something with that math doesnt add up if a yottabyte is 1k zettabytes and humans produce 1 zettabyte every 3 days wouldnt we pass that in 3k days
im gonna need one yotta byte please
i got an idea lets show a disgusting nail bitten thumb in the video wtf
with games getting bigger and more data being created each day you soon will need to add an another step to this vid
finally something on which i can download cod without having to uninstall my other games
finally a place to store my homework folder ive been meaning to upgrade to a 16 yottabyte drive get yalls priorities straight  
i was excitedly waiting for it to be a comprehensive setup for a yo momma joke but alas it wasnt meant to be
where ronnabyte and quettabyte at
so the snowball rolls on shrug
your math sounds wrong lol
i dont get it multiply 3 days 1 zb by 1000 is 3000 so 1 yottabyte is produced every 3000 days
and the human brain can in theory hold 42 yottabyte
hit subscribe then try the original web experience 
first time ive seen this website is in the svg element attribute it was probably named xmlns and had w3 link
now i just wanna code more html and js
physicists and mathematics  everything else those dudes carry the modern world
at least it doesnt use a js framework
but what about al gore
who knows bout this from angels and demons 
and americans still believe they invented it
that means ch was the first domain if i remember correctly
with document you mean pictures those pictures lonely researchers share 
now i know why the beginning of each url is www
thats right we invented the www 
now i know whats www stands for
im kind of a cern fan so this makes me reasonably happy
ah so this is who we have to thank for tiktok 
"a british guy invented www in switzerland and yet were taught that the internet was an american invention

i dont get why"
i want to get into politics tim berners lee was chinese
saw his keynote presentation on postgresql convention in 2019 he was hiiiiigh af
"oh so thats what w3 means
"
we invented internet 
i thought loudest animal is boomerang
"hi mom

pretty cool indeed"
not me looking for a steins gate meme
web 10 and cern are launched in 1989
and thats why i love my home country
british are the most intelligent race on earth
blender animation 
i never knew that the first web browser was written in objectivec the same language that iphone apps used to be written in
pretty cool riiight
and now its w3 this generation of the web js to implement money to the web like nft bitcoin etc web 2 is just to enhance the web 1
you spelled and pronounced al gore wrong
white people be like invents everything
not me getting  stains gate flashbacks

"man i wish i could share these documents with my fellow scientists
invents the world wide web"
built using react  
well at university we used message boards but also email through unix and vi and schools were connected
016 objc great
this is wrong
i love cern so much
its not responsive bad
me and all my homies hate cern
the swedish are so magnificent the music the science holy jizz
the story of the birth of javascript and the browser wars is so zany would recommend lex friedman interviewed the creator of js
you have suddenly become styropyro
i thought it was built on top of lisp
well the web hasnt changed much since then isnt it
el psy kongroo
objective c is a horrible language
he programmed it in c because he wanted to c other scientists
this is a test comment
too bad microsoft crushed it from growing
the web is born on macs

yes pretty cool

you did vim so i think itd be cool if you also did emacs in 100 seconds 
i cried man
nevermind the 666 in the cern logo and shiva statue in their front yard where lets say interesting things have happened
i wonder if thats a steinsgate reference
does that mean tim invented html too what a madlad
video of what is  30 that would be dope
basically youre talking about g0d
did you know that saying www is slower than saying world wide web
fcking awesome mate 
speaking of tim talk about the semantic web
hmmm ugly but remarkably functional makes me wonder whether apart from aesthetics and security the web has truly come as far as we think it has
whats your opinion on the daily mail article about w3c no longer fit for purpose for being hijacked by google
americans are mindblown when they find out they didnt invent the internet
it would be interesting story how cern wide web become www
this has been how the internet was born in 24 seconds
wowjpg
lol was the responsability typo ported over from the first panel
im pretty sure al gore invented the inter webz
i am old enough to remember it was not fun
he is the creator of the worst ever addiction human kind have ever known
that site hurts eyes
jeff is still my favourite tech youtuber
i honestly thought objective c was an apple thing
tim created html too
and people abandoned and forgot the greatness of objectivec

thats it i am officially starting web2000
i will just wait for web 6 by snoop dogg
how can i invest in web6 
there is already web10 and people are still in web5 and web6 xdd
if you have two web 3 and square it you got web 9
would have expected snoop to be working on web 420 tbh
cant wait for web8 in the next 5 years
im creating web12
besides web3 metaverse gaming is another potential field at the moment and in the future therefore take a look on the meradefi warrior 
web 6 all the way
calling eth a shitcoin puts this video in the troll category of way other level
wait where is the web 4 at
what happened to web 4
i miss geocities
the lambos are still coming
trùm cuối không làm ta thất vọng
web69 when
looking forward to web me
at this point theyre copying the show silicon valley
so yeah might as well wait for uncle snoop to release web 6 then ill drop web2 like its hot
"web69 under development with linus torvalds 
top secret project"
maybe these guys who built a website 20 years ago arent actually geniuses and in fact just built a website 20 years ago
esce que tu connais la plateforme que je développe 
looking for junior developers with 10 years experience in web5  web3 doesnt count  will be paid in dogecoin
my god can i have another web version that are not related to a cryptocurrency
web 30 was 15 years ago were on like web 420 anyone who talks about web 3 being about cryptocurrency is incompetent
silicon valley is web5 pied piper
and hes me with a 10 year old laptop
that just sounds like rest but with all personal information stored on the client which could be a good thing but that name alone will kill it
im putting my money on web7 because tsssssuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuu
"idk why theyre even trying to do this with bitcoin if anything they should partner with monero 

but in all reality this is all a joke in my opinion"
definitely lookin forward to web 6
this is literally that family guy joke where peter talks about world war 5 because its gonna be so big that its gonna overshadow ww 3 and 4
oh man i cant wait for the web69 the memes will be legendary
a web 5 just flew over my house
web 5 identity theft speedrun any glitched wr
ah yes web5 also known as the destruction of server authority and the rise of clientside cheats
"snoop dogg missed the web 420
 counting on elon i suppose"
when is web 7 coming
man i just cant wait for a web69 teaser
distributed webs have been around for over 20 years and never really became mainstream you cant just bump the version number and call it a new idea
web5 made by the founder of the most censorshipfriendly social site ever no thank you i will wait for web7 snoop dogg nice try 
with an ending like that i was sure he was going to say and i will see you in the next episode
wake up elon musk once we hit web420
the way you said the lambos are still coming so casually killed me
utopia ecosystem is new legend from messengers now
thanks intel
we already have decentralized internet
" at the center we must empower them with 
well they used that word so it must be a sillicon valley bs not interested"
if web3 is so good why there isnt a web4
this decentralized stuff is never going to happen there is too much money involved with the way the web works now
how about web 7  max x s ultra
do we really need another web
wait till web69 it will be revolutionary
this is damn hilarious
nah after web 3 we have to make web world web world 2 and then web 64
awesome video
waiting for web 7
web6 gang
id never heard of jack dorsey and now i wish i still hadnt
web 6 is gna be blazing fast cant wait sounds lit
were still on web 2 and were talking about web 5 already shoot far i guess
too bad they should have given web4 a chance
its always nice to see people solve problems that dont exist
036 thats a funny edit
lets go the ecma route and call it web 2022 with yearly releases
i prefer web 4 since its free from cryptocurrencies scams
ihow is this better  i find it funny when people are always arguing that attaching something to a block chain maes it different somehow
"web 6  adobe flash
web 7  java applets
web 8  works only in ie 6"
wait web3 is real i thought its just a joke from cryptobros
just like winamp 5 got created out of winamp 2 and winamp 3
why nobody is asking about web4 what happened to web4
they cannot make web0
its only a matter of time before we drop the bloated virtual machines that are web browsers markup its slow software
there must be web 5 pro version as well
its interesting how various irc networks 20 years ago were more decentralized than most crypto projects are today xd
web6 will be named web high 5
web95 anyone 
if web 3 is so good why theres no web 3 2
you can not kill something that never was a thing in the first place
this isnt a report this is mockery 
the sht coins users are desperate apparently theyre running out of people to scam while their coin is falling to the ground
its not weeb 5
so what should we do create our own web7 
older web has no clutter laughs in marquee blink several iframe with own scrollbars fragmented photos in a table matrix virus js
web6 gang
php is a great language it has transformed so much really no reason for people to hate on it
remember when php4 class constructor was a function with the same name as the class
does anyone know how is the melodymusic at the background called
shitty language
they also included the  operator so that shitty devs can hide error messages from functions
php is the web birches
i love php such a beautiful language
net developer will be jealous here
i am trying to use php but i cant use it with the live server extension can someone help me
php doesnt deserve the hate it gets i feel it started as a meme and newer gen devs ran with it
php was the first scripting language i learned and built some shitty ass websites with it
this was incredible thank you
the vid should have been 140 but it is 221
man 50 of the web is dead
bohot sahi video hai yar
147 is why ill always love php
i dont know man seemed to be more than 100 seconds so i didnt watch till the end
the title is fake this isnt a 100s this is a 140s
php must be forgotten its only legacy not more all fresh versions useless
you didnt make a case for php
142 unfortunately functions can either be firstclass or be named but they cannot be both
ive been using php for 100 years and though it sounds like youve never used it you did a bang up job explaining it in 100 seconds cheers
php seems like bash mixed with html
language for wordpress plugins
i made it even quicker  set your time speed x2 haha
whatever changes happen in the tech world php is still close to my heart and always will be 
i like how you assign function to php variableits so javascript and so not php 
lifes too short to be programming in php
php makes your website act like its on pcp
im still kind of new but i really like php
django in 100 seconds please 
php is paying me drugs and these drugs are making me study more php jk no php developer earns enough for buying good drugs lmao
hmm php wasnt bad
unlike node js which relies on billions of external packages
personal home page
where is sound
hmm i was sure it was pretty helpless processing but thats just me
even though variables are dynamic in type from php 74 you can declare typed class properties 
php no thank you
worst language 
it might not be a dead language but it should be
booooooh
and most importantly never forget the semicolon
php is very good i wonder why someone hates php even though now i am working with node
according to him at the last minute php stands for personal homepage 
must resistthe urgeto learnphp
bro u 100 seconds about all popular langoop this better knowledge awesome
php is my first love and only love
the og
i hope i never have to learn it
i played with php last night because i wanted an email form that wouldnt open outlook now i cant stop learning about php is this how they get you
software dev meme 
php was my first love codependence is a bitch
lamp stack was the easiest to setup and deploy than mean stack
its not the time that matters but the quality of content hats up for you 
php my fav language 
these day i rarely use php for anything else than a data entry backend but still i dont get the hate for it
beans
why not do laravel in 100s next
with laravel and symfony php is a beast for backend
no matter how much hate there is for php still way better then js
привет русским я php джун и собираю закрытый чатик в телеге для джунов пиши свой тг в комментах будем нетворкаться и помогать друг другу
please please dont write php in current year with php mode and html
we need a php for the haters in 100 seconds
php the most hated language on the internet
we need a language thats just better php

and click control shift daughter _
the voice crack teest first 
its literally like this every day
im not alone my goodness
ai  do i look as clown to you 
as a software engineer this is so relatable
then you remember about chat gpt by the way i am not promoting chat gpt
this is me everyday
you left out the part where this is all happening at 3 am
ask chatgpt
search in files js  error message this is time division handmade error  very old fun from seniors working perfect all times
i getting more and more used of just coping the error codes into chatgdp its better than stack overflow
pretty accurate
i am new to programming and fear this will be my life from now on
chat gpt lol
thank god ai is a thing these days
add gpt into the mix and when even those cant solve it or make dumb mistakes like you have been all along then you know you are really fd
my last week in a yt shorts 
pov  me when i fix a print function in python
"write code
code doesnt work
dont know why
fix the code
code now works
dont know why
 repeat until you are dead"
chatgpt
coding is like musterbating in reverse you regret it first love it after
"me with the code trycatch
bro are you really rn"
great summary of programmers life
i miss the days chat gdp didnt exist and you needed to search hours for one small error
your name is fireship dont give up now
this hit my soul
fireship bruh
me on my first day at work as a full stack developer
these is now obsolete just ask chatgpt
ahh yes the daily life of a programmer
developing goes hand in hand with mood swings
100 percent accurate
too relatable
man the worst thing is if you find the same problem on stackoverflow but even after applying all steps it wont run making it even worse
great now dont touch it
as a react developer i can vouch for it
idk but i was waiting chatgpt to popup and solve the problems 
lmao its more accurate when your code report makes me feel like that too
ask chat gpt its 2023
just chatgpt it
two moods of a programmer
try catch and forget that existed
why tf is stack overflow that way
just chat gtp it
"i faced the same thing with my bash script
 im not even a programmer


hence why ill be making most of my stuff foss"
laughs in github
wait you guys write a flow chart before coding it
i think this is the best video fireship has ever made
you should get chatgpt to help you debug its very good at that
this was me today 
the worst one is no error but still didnt work 
laughs in chatgpt
this happens constantly when i just start out a new coding language
uncaught error you did nothing wrong but heres an error cuz im bored 
embedded systems programming takes this to a whole other level
i hate when it works again for no reason like please tell me whats wrong
run it through chatgbt
everyday im further convinced this account is ai
i could spend days trying to get something to work until i start having anxiety is this normal
me everyday _
maybe the error was caused by the browser cache but when you refreshed again it finally cleared the cash and used fresh files
chatgpt
stack overflow are buch of losers
just use chatgpt
 all too familiar depending if i am interpreting the correctly
i swear this is me
i always wanted to pursue computer science but my father thought i cant do it because i cant type proffesionally but i got 200 wpm on monkey typing 
coding is only fun if you know what youre doing 
me everyday
this is so true 
what was that diagram
you go to college for programming
gpt it
nah i have cs degree and i dont even know how to code
"i know what is on the display 
sudo apt install hollywood"
chat gpt am i a joke to you
pointless shorts hes the reason why youtubers say please subscribe you can always unsubscribe later
texting your crush and waiting for a response be like
i feel dizzy when i see stackoverflow ui
"if its error you hate programming 
but if passed  i love prograaming"
its thy will of the machine spirit your code runs
i swear  i just had the same energy after my code had an error
realises that chatgpt exists

im really enjoying astro
after starting with react several years ago nothing put me in hype mode except astro so simple and elegant 
so is this another approach of html over the wire
so its like a newer php
so wheres your personal portfolio with astro 
will use it to build my website with svelte 
do an astro  svelte  sveltekit premium tut on fireship pro plz or like nextjs  astro
when is the full astro video coming out i cant wait
this very vid clip made it to the react conf 2021 today
i did not know about this but i was actually just thinking about a needing something along the lines of this
looking forward to this tutorial of astro
i have one question how does this compare with prerendering and then hydrating is there a way to prevent js from being loaded at all
"the definition of genius is taking the complex and making it simple
albert einstein"
sounds like it would be less clunky to use than gatsby with the same features
i watch your videos at normal speed  all others at 150 lol 
is that an nsx gauge cluster at 025 please tell me thats an nsx gauge cluster at 025
it would be great if astro used vite instead of snowpack vite has a much larger community while snowpack lacks it
every fucking day a new thing to learn 
hey jquery is still cool and hip right

after using tons of tools i stick with react the most comprehensive and fast enough one
seems similar to nextjs but not only for react
woahthis is dope everyone hating on here either needs to get with it or get out of the way astro is really something special 
wow first time i have not seen angular icon in popular frameworks list is angular dead already
so its just hugo and jekyll

ah yes what my job will be mostly in the future once the updates are done
idk what a rails dev like me is watching this for but that looks cool
playwright  cypress
weve ended up using playwright instead of cypress had some problems with ts with cypress and playwright setup was just smooth as butter
dude thinks 2 minutes and 30 seconds are 100 seconds   please like so he sees this
next video should be types of tests in 100 seconds

liking before watching 
after trying playwright for e2e and api testing cypress doesnt look so great anymore although it still remains a good option for component testing
i really love cypress  even now i have to use react i feel save to delivery some quality 
thank you
elm in 100 seconds
quasar
thank you so much  loved the bite sized content exactly what i was looking for
taking my first cssjavascripthtml class right now and this channel has never been more helpful
im only now getting the hang of css and im already looking into cool frameworks and tools its all a black box anyway 
217 now vscode has the feature
that was great
thanks it is just amazing  thanks for the bonus i am looking for it thanks alott 
video never end in 100 sec it take time upto 150 to 170 secs
useless in most cases optional i would say
why css doesnt updates it self with these features  i mean they did it with variables why stop there 
thanks for sharing team fireship this was really helpful and gave a basic idea
now bracket pair colorize is builtin into vscode you just have to enable it from the settings
"sass
super css
super ass"
your video is awesome as saas tnx
nevernesters vs sass
these x in 100 or so seconds  videos have been very helpful to me gets to the point without waste of time thank you mr fireship
so it is basically what c is to c but for css got it
what a great explanation 
bracket pair colorizer is now builtin to vs code
111  is not to apply to a direct sibling you have  for that
just awesome thanks for share
whatt this existed
i like your 100 seconds series nowadays people arent having enough time to watch for tutorial that is over 10 mins
the bracket pair colorizer now comes builtin in vscode
a little fast but 
its nice to see the bracket pair colorizer as a builtin feature in vscode
color coded brackets take me away
the vs code extension bracket pair colorizer is now native to the code editor woohoo
opensource instead of creating good standards css we start doing additional compilers  bundler plugins  linting plugins this is not good engineering
what is  intro website  name displayed in video
information overload never thought i would say that after a 100 second video of a tech ive already used apparently not as effectively as i could
i literally never saw what is this and was like sass why when i have css and now i see why sass its freaking awesome as the name says
amazing style sheets
bracket colors are now native in vscode
bootstrap in 100 seconds please
why isnt all of this just part of css
yoo this channel is so freaking goooooooooooood
"superb  learnt alot in just 100 seconds the presentation of the video is so awesome
keep it up"
023 this somehow reminds me of python
php got down and dirty with css and now we have whatever this is
vscode now has bracket pair colorizing built in
"sas
sus amogus"
is there any extension like bracket color for html tags
i made some less than savory noises while watching this
for anyone interested vscode now has its own bracket pair colorizer the extension is no longer maintained
so is sass turing complete
i think sass is paid not open source
the best part of this video was learning about bracket pair colorizer
video is awesome however that pikachu gif was sad
anyone else thought that sass means super advance style sheet
i just got a rickroll ad while watching this
omg i need this language in my life nowwww
sass is sus 
this thing is the same age as me bruh
the yass language
yassified programming
sass is kinda sus please dont kill me
sus programming language 
131 i see what you did there
as of 122021 bracket pair colorizer is now a native feature in vsc accessible in settings and the addon has been deprecated
sass suss
sass is sus
"so in short word
its jscss"
now say it without the first letter
make a video about lessjs
this bracket pair colorizer seems nifty for flutter and the bracket hell i find myself writing lmao
this sounds kinda like less because mixins can be rewritten in less as a class that isnt used in the dom and is used with parens
ok my today goal  learn scss
one sad thing sass is missing is changing variables which is the reason i have to use regular css variables
im pretty sure vs code now has a builtin setting for bracket colorisation
sass is just javscirpt with css
"youll find yourself repeating yourself
damnfeels like that wordplay was intendedrapper jeff in the house d"
this was like css on steroids
sass is just as old as me
anyone can tell the name of effect used in thumbnail for rounded stripes they seem like a paint trace pretty i wanna make it in css
im madly in love with your 100s series   things just seem to be so much easier to understand when you explain it
now finally colored brackets are built in vs code 160 the feature is way faster than the extension
bracket colorizer is now built in the last vscode update
useless with the speed it is explained
what a high quality video you are just a legend
holy crap sass is awesome
so basically its js in css
hitting the like button for every 100 seconds video 
wow thank you for bonus
i love that pro tipp at the end 
goood  helpful

brilliant mate
why design new graphics or write hundreds of lines of code if someone else has done it for you
abc of the script kiddie
i feel that most people wont appreciate the true wow in the beginning

yeah but the funny part comes when you find keyframes lol
minimal web 
omg these videos

please stop dont make the web more bloated than it already is
you gotta talk like the youngsters bro you gotta say hot to skid useless animations from websites
web development isnt engineering
someone like my comment please
why do you need to show of your skills to a friend this is the worst kind of programing people
"this guy adds too much value to us

we must protect him at all costs i repeat at all costs"
wow o
only if i knew this earlier when i had my assignment for designing my own website from html and css
didnt knew that ctrl  c and ctrl  v was the shortcut sequence for reverse engineering

hey is there a way to build a theme toggle without js using only css and html
html canvas in 100seconds
bro also put tutorials for ember javascript there are not so much tutorials available for ember if you upload that video then it will be good
found your channel via the google feed on my android phone swipe right thought id let you know
is there a solid reason to use these when you preprocess your css with sass or less which have these variables anyway
i double up the speed of the video and i learned it in 50 seconds
ie support doesnt exist and the polyfill will choke on larger style sheets with many variables  one day
