I'm curious if anyone has an opinion on this; I've been doing some research into Data Structures and most of the courses I've come across implement Java while teaching which is why I've chosen it as my first programming language. Is there a special kind of fidelity of Java towards Data Structures and Algorithms or is it just because the language is widespread?,0

"This was the first programming language I learned back in the German equivalent of high school. I remember how we programmed old-school style with the vanilla editor and compiled it by cmd. As I went to university we had Java again and I made the cardinal sin to take it easy. I did not take the programming classes seriously and the programming assignments went difficult quick.

The biggest issues I had were understanding the OOP-principles in detail and using them to solve the issues. Especially the assignment about a DoublyLinkedList was pushing me to my limits. After changing from a university to a university of applied science, I got better and could re-learn and understand. I changed my mindset and I am about to learn C/C++ as well as Javascript and Python.",0
java is da best,0
yeah... i understood that. Clueless...,0
"I am too old and need to stay away from such videos....because I can't understand why people are willing to learn five different ""languages"" (smirk) and then go through the compiling stage, when programming directly to the processor (machine language) is so much more efficient, especially since processors have changed (RISC and embedded mini controllers). Oh well, retirement beach here I come!

Oh and showing different class levels doesn't really teach programming (in my opinion).",0

"1:15 ""The class is required to have a main method"" - well, it may create some misconceptions, because not _every_ class is required to have a main method.

"They say all java programs need to have the public static void main method as an entry point, but this isn't the case when you're using it for Android development. Android apps can be entered at various points by various apps or from the desktop environment so it depends on if the app is being launched from the desktop or if another app is calling it through something called an intent filter described in the manifest XML file of the app. This will determine the activity it is opened into, which calls the onCreate method when its lifecycle begins and this inflates the layouts for that particular activity, rather than having any one particular main entry point like most programs do that are simply called from a single point via a terminal prompt or something like that. Those String[] args are designed to accept inputs from the command line when you call the program.",0

In the future, I might be a successful web developer, and I owe it to you all. Again, thank you very much :))",0

"I really want to support you and pay for this course but, here's the deal. I don't mind paying Google or Paypal to handle my transactions. As much as I don't like them, I know they have a vested interest in handling my transactions accurately and securely. Not because they're angels, but because I'm too small to target and have more interest in international law than, perhaps, I should. I'm small potatoes. Tiny, even, online. Any breach - or even shenanigans from WITHIN either paypal or google - with regard to my accounts - and I'm going to know it. Instantly. Which will afford me the very short time required to nail what little connections I DO have down and lock the doors. I understand that sellers don't like the idea of it but there are very, VERY few things I'll buy if they're not an option. I'm just saying...I'm not putting my credit card info on your site. I'm old school business and paypal and google fees are simply tax-deductible ""expense"" items to be figured into the sale price, from my perspective. Or, even, direct ""cost of sales"" items because not using them would leave so much revenue on the table.

Obviously - if you're a black hat that doesn't want to use paypal or google, that's fine. I don't have any issues with that but I'm too old to enjoy the cat and mouse dance.",0

"Hey there! I am stuck somewhere. from the HTML structure part, the first class never works when I make a separate CSS file. for example, in this code, the subscribe-button is the first class. So when I run it in from a different CSS file I get a basic subscribe button while the subscribe-button:hover and subscribe-button:active are still working. In order to get the first class working I had to add in a dummy class(I added subscribe-button:cue and left it empty) and then it worked. Any thoughts on why it might be happening .
By the way, the course is great I didn't know anything about HTML CSS and I feel like I already learned so much. This is way better than all those paid courses that many websites are offering.",0

"my college degree started us out with Java. I hated it at first , but looking back I am glad it was my first programming language. We used a little python and then finished up with C/C++ and Linux so we could make our own Compilers .  It doesn't really make sense until after you do it? That's my best advice for beginners / people who want to get into Programming. Pick a solid language to learn with... Java, Python... or C (if you are a Chad) / maybe Javascript if you want to get into Web Development at some point . I am writing websites and Learning javascript right now before I graduate this summer ... After getting comfortable with Java for a few years, Javascript frickin' scares me .  Python is so nice, elegant, Java is so Secure, Robust ...  But yeah I wanna break into the industry with Web Development so I gotta learn it... But that's the point I think I was trying to make... It takes a whileeee for language syntax to sink in, so having a strong foundational understanding of Classes, Methods and Objects  , variables.. the basic structure to OOP is the important thing.    Or, you were born for this stuff and can pick up a new language in about 3 days ...  Frameworks/Stacks is another important concept too...   Research which type of Job you would want, and what kind of tools they use in that profession . Oh... And ChatGPT ... just use it...   But don't Rely on it for real. Put a good 2-4 hours a week set aside to building your own personal Projects.  The more you do, the more you can do... but again, the more you understand , the more you realize how much you DONT UNDERSTAND.  It can be hell... But hey, I was lifting 80 pound bags of Concrete for 15 bucks an hour all day... I would rather fry my Brain then my Back for a living .  I eventually want to get into the Gaming industry, but I know I am a long wayyysss away from understanding C++ and Huge File Systems/Game Engines , so I will become Competent with JS / TS.. HTML/CSS... Node... and then keep working on C++ / Game Engines on my downtime .",0

You may know java, c# or python but there are so many other stuff they require. Most of time, for java developer position, they require you to know spring framework, sql as well as react or angular + clouding technology like aws or azure and docker, jackins and system designing skills etc etc. It's so frustrating that you have to know so much to get developer jobs. :(",0

"Here are some of the key things I have learned:

Information technology refers to the use of digital systems, software, and networks to store, process, and communicate information.
IT encompasses a wide range of technologies, including hardware (such as computers and mobile devices), software (such as operating systems and applications), networks (such as the internet and intranets), and storage systems (such as cloud computing and databases).
IT has transformed many aspects of modern life, including business, education, entertainment, and communication.
Some of the key subfields within IT include cybersecurity, data science, software engineering, web development, and artificial intelligence.
IT professionals often work in roles such as IT support, network administration, software development, data analysis, and project management.
IT is a rapidly evolving field, with new technologies and innovations emerging all the time. Staying up-to-date with the latest developments is essential for IT professionals.
Overall, information technology plays a critical role in modern society, enabling people and businesses to communicate, collaborate, and innovate in ways that were once impossible.",0

1. If you are the type who prefers to start with something easier, go with Python._x000D_
2. If you are the type who enjoys a challenge, go with C++.

Based on my experience, I started with C++ and found its learning curve to be quite steep; for a whole month, I slept, ate, coded, and repeated without touching the sun. However, this enabled me to think more deeply about the structure of my code when translating to other languages like Java, C#, VB, or Python. It also taught me how memory management works, which I consider to be one of the most important aspects of programming.

Starting with C++ can be beneficial, but it should not be attempted by those who are not up for a challenge.",0

I have dabbled in a few languages over the years but I've yet to really make anything.

I downloaded a text editor and inspected the code and discovered LUA for the first time. Super easy and readable language. I was actually able to intuitively figure out how to create a new button. Afterwards I figured out how to create a whole new remote which I made for controlling Ren'Py games. Kind of gave me the coding bug again and I find myself looking for the next step. I want to make something else. Something bigger. I'm just not sure what.,0

"After watching the video, I can say that the speaker's experience with coding is quite impressive. I think it's great that they started learning coding at a young age and then went on to do several internships across multiple countries. It shows that they have a lot of knowledge and experience in different programming languages._x000D_
_x000D_
I agree with the speaker's point that it's important to start with something useful but not too difficult when learning to code. Jumping into a complex project can be overwhelming and demotivating, which is why starting with a language like Python or JavaScript can be beneficial as they are easier to learn._x000D_
_x000D_
I also appreciate the distinction that the speaker made between coding and programming. I think it's important to understand the fundamentals of coding before moving on to programming as it can help to avoid confusion and frustration._x000D_
_x000D_
I would say that the speaker's approach to learning coding is a good one. It's always best to start with the basics and then move on to more complex tasks once you have a good understanding of the programming language.

"Hi there. Interesting YT video. 

I agree with a lot you said here, it's a shame you didn't go into C# more or recommend it further, as it's my favourite language and I now do game Development with it.

I started many years ago at University with C/C++/Assembly/Verilog/Matlab, and yeah I really struggled with C at first, I had no YT like today or books to find easy, just the C programming website and a web printed off version of the C programming language that was one sided abd 100s of pages long, it was about 5/6 inches thick and if you see the orginal book it's less than an inch thick, I should have just bought that! Lol

But yeah C was demoralising, I just didn't ""get it"" when I was doing it, I had to go forward to come back and it wasn't until I started to do classes and Assembly with microcontrollers things started to click better. I HATED Matlab though, that was for Control Systems and well it was blah.

My real journey started when I did my own study at home using Java abd Android, which then led me down a path to Html/css/js and then C# once U made my own small game on Android, I then switched to Unity. Mind you this was after Uni I started Unity, but started Java in my last year at Uni.

If I were to advise someone on how to go about learning how to create their own programs and get into programming, I would point them to this video as you pretty much said what I would. People always bypass C, learning Python first then either only learning JS or Java/C#, without learning the Kernel languages.

Maybe a little discussion on Java/C# if you ever do an uodated version, that really would make this video one of the best I've seen in a while.

Nice video though...nice one. ??

I started learning python roughly a year ago and I tried to learn by building interesting projects and prototypes, such as a virtual assistant, a day trade bot and a security camera for my room using a motion detector, an aimbot with a haar cascade classifier, among other things. I learned a lot from this but I felt that, like you said, I was at the peak of Mt. Stupid and when I started watching this harvard CS50 course on computer science, there were a lot of things I didn't know but now I have a more solid foundation for computer science (I'm actually 1/3rd of the way done with the lengthy video) and maybe then I can take another whack at machine learning, hopefully.

I thought it was weird that nobody tried to train it to walk properly from scratch (without any external data), so I wanted to give it a shot! That�s what I said 4 months ago. It�s been really difficult, but I�ve finally managed to do it, so please watch the whole video! The final result ended up being awesome :)_x000D_
_x000D_
NOTE: From the last video, you guys made it clear you didn�t like that Albert had his brain reset, so from now his brain is here to stay (hopefully)! The next video I make with Albert will start with the brain we trained in this video, so with every video Albert will become more and more capable until he eventually learns to break out of my computer and take over the world. You also can only see one Albert, but there are actually 200 copies of Albert and the room he�s in training behind the camera to speed up the training._x000D_
_x000D_
If you want to learn more about how Albert actually works, you can read the rest of this very long comment I wrote explaining exactly how I trained him! (and please let the video play in the background while reading so YouTube will show Albert to more people)_x000D_
_x000D_

THE BASICS_x000D_
I created everything using Unity and ML-Agents. Albert is controlled entirely by an artificial brain (neural network) which has 5 layers, the first layer consists of the inputs (the information Albert is given before taking action, like his limb positions and velocities), the last layer tells him what actions to take and the middle 3 layers, called hidden layers, are where the calculations are performed to convert the inputs into actions. His brain was trained using the standard algorithm in reinforcement learning; proximal policy optimization (PPO)._x000D_
_x000D_
For each of Albert�s limbs I�ve given him (as an input) the position, velocity, angular velocity, contacts (if it�s touching the ground, wall or obstacle) and the strength applied to it. I�ve also given him the distance from each foot to the ground, direction of the closest target, the direction his body�s moving, his body�s velocity, the distance from his chest to his feet and the amount of time one foot has been in front of the other. As for his actions, we allow Albert to control each body part�s rotation and strength (with some limitations so his arm can�t bend backwards, for example)._x000D_
_x000D_
Just like the last videos, Albert was trained using reinforcement learning. For each of Albert's attempts, we calculate a score for how 'good' it was and make small, calculated adjustments to his brain to try to encourage the behaviors that led to a higher score and avoid those that led to a lower score. You can think of increasing Albert�s score as rewarding him and decreasing his score as punishing him, or you can think about it like natural selection where the best performing Alberts are most likely to reproduce. For this video there are 13 different types of rewards (ways to calculate Albert's score), we start off with only a couple and with each new room add more, always in an attempt to get him to walk._x000D_
_x000D_

REWARD FUNCTION_x000D_
Room 1: We start off very simple in the first room, we reward him based on how much he moved to the target and we punish him for moving in the wrong direction. This led to Albert doing the worm towards the target, since he figured out that was the easiest way for him to move the quickest/get the highest score. It would have been possible to get Albert to walk in a janky way by just rewarding him for moving towards the target and also punish him for falling as a team at Google (DeepMind) showed in 2017, but I thought it would make for a more enjoyable video if he starts off with the worm and over time learns to use his legs, rather than immediately being able to partially walk._x000D_
_x000D_
Room 2: In the second room we start checking if his limbs hit the ground. If the limb that hits the ground is a foot we reward him (but only if it's in front of his other foot, more on that later), if it isn�t, we punish him. I also made it so Albert wasn�t rewarded at all unless his chest was high enough to force it to at least be partially standing. As seen in the video, this encourages him to not fall over and encourages him to use his feet to do it. We also introduced a new reward designed to encourage smoother movement; if he approaches the maximum strength allowed on a limb he's punished, and he's rewarded if he uses a strength of almost 0. This encourages him to opt for the more human-like movement of using a bit of strength from many limbs as opposed to a lot of strength from one limb._x000D_
_x000D_
Room 3: This is where we start to polish Albert�s gait that developed in room 2 and teach him to turn. From here on we start using the chest height calculation as another direct reward where the higher his chest is the more he�s rewarded in an attempt to get him to stand up as straight as possible. These rewards so far give Albert a decent gait, however he�s still not using both of his feet (which was by far the hardest part of this project), so room 4 is designed to do exactly that._x000D_
_x000D_
Room 4: We get Albert to take more steps from a few additional rewards. To start, we introduce a 2 second timer that resets when one foot goes in front of the other. We reward Albert whenever this timer is above 0 (the front foot has been in front for < 2 seconds), and we punish him whenever the timer goes below 0 (the front foot has been in front > 2 seconds). We add another reward proportional to the distance of his steps to encourage him to take larger steps. To smooth out the movement, we also add a punishment every frame proportional to the difference in his body�s velocity from the previous frame to the current frame, so if he�s moving at a perfectly consistent velocity he isn�t punished at all, and if he makes very quick erratic movements he�s punished a lot._x000D_
_x000D_
Room 5: For the final room the only change I made to the reward function was to go back to an earlier version of a reward. Throughout the other rooms I had been tinkering with how I should reward Albert�s feet being grounded, my initial thought was to only reward the front foot for being grounded to try to get him to put more weight on his front foot when taking steps, but somewhere along the way I changed it to just rewarding Albert for any foot being grounded, and that was the version Albert trained with in rooms 3 and 4. For this final room I switched back to the old front foot grounded reward which resulted in a much nicer looking walk. Also, the video makes it seem like I never reset Albert�s brain, that isn't entirely true, I had to occasionally reset it because of something called decaying plasticity._x000D_
_x000D_

OTHER_x000D_
Decaying plasticity was a big issue. Basically, Albert�s brain specializes a lot from training in one room, then training in the next room on top of that brain is difficult because he first needs to unlearn that specialization from the first room. The best way to solve the issue is by resetting a random neuron every once in a while so over time he �forgets� the specialization of the network without it ever being noticeable, the problem is I don�t know how to do that through ML-Agents. My solution was to keep training on top of the same brain, but if Albert�s movement doesn�t converge as needed I record another attempt trained from scratch, then stitch the videos together when their movements are similar. If you know how to reset a single neuron in ML-Agents please let me know! The outcome from both methods is exactly the same, but it would be a smoother experience having the neurons reset over time instead of all at once._x000D_
_x000D_
For rooms 1 to 4 I only allowed Albert to make a decision every 5 game ticks, but for the final room I removed that constraint and let him make decisions every frame. I found if Albert makes a decision every game tick it�s too difficult for him to commit to any proper movements, he ends up just making very small movements like slightly pushing his front foot forward when he should be taking a full step. The 5 game tick decision time forces him to commit to his decision for at least 5 game ticks so he ends up being more careful when moving a limb. When I recorded him beating the final room I removed this limitation because he�s already learned to commit to his actions so allowing him to make a decision every tick just results in a smoother motion._x000D_

If you�re still reading this thank you for being so interested in the project! I�d like to upload much more often than once every few months, and to do that I need some help. I have 2 part time positions open, one for a Unity AI Developer and one for a Unity Scene Designer. It would start off as part time (paid per project) but I�d love to get someone full time provided they�re skilled enough:) If you think you�d be able to help, please apply here for the AI Developer position: forms.gle/rExRJCKcxNmxnBRu5 and here for the Scene Designer position: forms.gle/VafZTMZ8QMruSBiRA I�ve hidden these job postings in this long pinned comment to make sure anybody who applies is interested enough in the videos to actually read the whole comment, so thank you for reading all the way through!:D Also if you have any ideas for how to improve the AI (or solve the issue of decaying plasticity with ML-Agents), include the text ""Technical idea"" in your comment so I can find it easier!

"Learning a programming language effectively requires time and effort, but there are strategies you can employ to expedite the learning process. Here are some tips to help you learn any programming language efficiently:

Set Clear Goals: Clearly define your learning objectives and set specific, achievable goals. Identify what you want to accomplish with the programming language and break down your goals into manageable milestones. Having a clear roadmap will provide direction and motivation throughout your learning journey.

Focus on Fundamentals: Start by mastering the fundamental concepts of programming, such as variables, loops, conditionals, and functions. These concepts form the building blocks of any programming language. Once you understand these fundamentals, transitioning to a new programming language becomes easier as you mainly need to grasp the syntax and specific language features.

Hands-On Practice: Actively engage in hands-on coding exercises and projects. Learning by doing is crucial in programming. Write code regularly to reinforce your understanding of the language. Solve coding challenges, work on mini-projects, and experiment with different functionalities. Practical application helps solidify your knowledge and build confidence.

Read and Analyze Code: Study well-written code samples and projects in the programming language you're learning. Analyze how experienced developers structure their code, follow best practices, and solve problems efficiently. Reading and understanding code written by others enhances your comprehension and exposes you to different coding styles.

Utilize Documentation and Resources: Make use of official documentation and online resources specific to the programming language. Documentation provides detailed explanations of language features, syntax, and libraries. Online tutorials, video courses, and coding platforms can supplement your learning and provide practical examples.

Join Coding Communities: Engage with coding communities, forums, and social media groups dedicated to the programming language you're learning. Interact with other learners and experienced developers to exchange knowledge, ask questions, and seek guidance. Participating in coding communities fosters a supportive learning environment and provides valuable insights.

Build Projects and Solve Real-World Problems: Apply your knowledge by working on projects that align with your interests and goals. Practical projects allow you to integrate different concepts, explore advanced features, and solve real-world problems. Building projects enhances your problem-solving skills and provides a tangible demonstration of your progress.

Embrace a Growth Mindset: Learning a new programming language can be challenging at times. Embrace a growth mindset and view difficulties as opportunities for growth. Be patient, persistent, and maintain a positive attitude. Celebrate your achievements and learn from your mistakes.

Regarding ""gildware technologies,"" as mentioned before, it seems that the term ""gildware"" is not widely recognized. If you intended to refer to a specific topic or technology, kindly provide more details, and I'll do my best to assist you accordingly.",0

Thank you so so much for doing this - I'm the worst at learning new things and in just 10 mins i'm already learning so much. You're awesome.,0
"I am a semi-retired production support / devops engineer who also has coded in various forms for over 40 years. I enjoy coding and learning, and I recently discovered an active, positive, inclusive dev streaming community on Twitch. One of the streamers was practicing with online flash cards, then doing online code challenges, then working on front-end project assignments from an online resource. I was impressed with the study method and how they were learning, and they and their chat would sing the praises of ""Leon"". I checked Leon out. I've always tried to be open and share my knowledge, but I've always been bad at it, and also I had no idea how someone would start learning code from scratch today as opposed to getting an 8-bit computer that booted straight to BASIC in 1979 and learning bit by bit from there. So I started watching Leon to learn how to teach and what tools and sites new devs use. I am both impressed and inspired by what Leon and his team and his community is accomplishing, and I help answer questions in the Discord community. And I end up learning a lot more than I thought I would. And while I have no interest in full-time employment, I think Leon's teachings on getting jobs will help me find freelance enjoyable side projects in retirement for some extra money. Leon is the real deal, and he is helping folks change their lives. For free and/or getting paid in the process.",0

"full stack is the only way to be a wise dev and have insight, foesight and oversight. I cannot do backend work without testing frontend and creating both myself to avoid the left hand not knowing what the right hand is doing (dont work in teams)",0
"I have 25 years behind me webmastering, and you sound like and oldskooler too who has stayed up wth current trends. Fantastic synopsis man. When i began in the days of 1990's we had static html and ftp upload, then mysql and php came, and dynamic web.. now look where we are!",0

"I actually want to be backend developer. I think I would like front end too. But I see that with front end it�s much more possible to get a first job if you don�t have a degree? Because you can create multiple projects  to show before possible interviews. What do you think start in front get a job, experience, while working learn something like java or C++ and get a backend job. Does it make sense?",0

I don't understand why people even mention R. It has nothing to do with general purpose programming. It would be really really dumb to use it for website development.,0
I think JavaScript UI frameworks are greatly overrated and unnecessary for the vast majority of websites. I'd assign it as a low priority thing to learn for new developers. They should focus almost entirely on vanilla Javascript. I'd put Typescript and Node ahead of any Javascript UI framework.,0
Very helpful,0

"The answers given for CoT shows a different understanding of the concept than is referred to in the latest ArXiV paper on the topic.  Here, you've gotten the model to give you a prompt template that it recommends using in order to suck a very comprehensive swathe of thoughts out or get a response including a vast array of thinking about a topic from specific angles meant to provide a response in essay form on a topic that ensures a most comprehensive essay on the given topic.  Basically if you need a report on a topic that is overall encouraging it's utilization or provides an optimistic point of view about whatever subject you give it then you just sneak in a mention of Donald and all of a sudden your thoughts are expanded on in the most verbose and spontaneous way by the response to your prompt that was simply asking for some suggestions on firing a coworker, Donald , over email or drinks afterwork.",0

Traversy is more generous and dedicated person I have ever seen. Love from Bangladesh?,0
"Thank you so much for continuing your yearly efforts on these updates. I do not consider myself a professional web developer, mainly because I dabble in too many media disciplines, it's hard to concentrate on just one. As such, I have been an Adobe user for decades and started playing with website development in the Macromedia days of Dreamweaver, repeatedly drifted away, and then returned to Dw over the years. I began to get wise to Adobe about the time they pushed Adobe Business Catalyst and Muse, only to pull the rug out and shut it all down. I recently heard Xd could be the latest Adobe product to go through a major shake-up and have also noticed Dw has not received much love as of late (still on Bootstrap v4.4). Now once again I find my interests are moving back toward Web Development and I am wondering what your thoughts are on Dreamweaver. Is it still worth using or would I be better off moving to something like VSC?",0

"Hi, I'm an absolute beginner and I'm interested in web technologies. Should i learn PHP as my first programming language in 2023? Or should I start with Javascript. Im  not sure is it stil longer worth learning to Code because of the AI?

Can you geve me any advice pls about it? thx",0

Wow! What an incredible video.,0
I don�t like python for backend development. It�s too slow for data heavy apps.,0
"I would like to ask you for your professional advice, 
I am a Designer by Trade, and Geek by Birth, I am very proficient in design software, 
and have gotten into web design / development, I find myself now gravitating towards a more serious note in ui/ux, however i find it difficult to learn coding in such a speed that it would catch up with my 20 years of experience as a designer,. 

Is there a recommendation you would point me towards, ?
So i am able to utilized the experience under my belt ?

I am very proficient in business, servers, all adobe software, bare metal, etc etc etc,
however when it comes to anything which involves coding, i cant seem to learn fast enough ?

Currently I am at the point where i am elevating to the next level, 
however I just can't seem to find that "" software "" to help me tie up all experience and put it to use. 

For example, I am an artist that is a geek, so adobe was natural, 
then i realized, web design was easy with CMS, but now i just cant seem to find my "" builder "",
when it comes to UI/UX. 

I certainly understand lots of practice is involved, 
I am currently trying our bootstrap, php storm, vs code, and visual studio, 
but it all seems harder than it is suppose to be without the "" visual design software element "" it ?

Sort of like.... I was willing to learn code to assist in presenting hand drawn art, 
but its really hard for me to start with code, and turn that into art ?

Well, any how, Thank you for reading, 
Thank you in advance, i deeply appreciate all solid advice from experts everywhere.

Thank you guys and God Bless.

P.S. / FYI } The site is for a 501c, Our name is World Animal Rescue inc. 
The reason for the need to elevate ui/ux and design is because i wanted to make it easier to involve everyone.",0

"Oh God firebase, I'm supporting an application built on the Google cloud and firebase now and just supporting it is a nightmare. There's no way to directly query it without writing code a user interface is really clunky and not very helpful if you're trying to do any kind of complex where clause or joins across the documents. And I still have not figured out how to run at locally so that I can do local development, it may be possible but I don't have time to go through all that documentation and experimentation.",0

It looks great until it becomes popular...every tech stack.,0
"Obviously don't use all of that first stack in your first project, that's insane. But robustness, scalability, testability, seamless deployment, good source management, etc are all things to aspire to. A lot of it makes so much more sense when you actually get around to using it instead of just lurking on the outside, coming from experience. So make bigger and bigger projects as you learn. 

Some domains also just demand a lot more. Healthcare, for example. Imagine botching your deployment and having 6 hours of downtime while providing a service used by hospitals. (I mean, it happens all the time, but it really shouldn't)",0

"In my opinion. A lot of companies are extending the time spent on development by using too many libraries. For example, graphql might be very convenient, but for christ sake, you could handle the requests and data filtering yourself and it will cause you less issues when your team isn't completely comfortable with graphql for them to just write their own function on the backend that grabs the data from the database and selects the columns they needs and packs them in json. A lot of time you can speed up performance and reduce pressure on your servers by pushing json objects where ever you can. Yes I've heard the argument of that it's bad since relational databases are fast and you should add json, etc... I disagree. A good mixture of both has given me the best performance everytime when done correctly. Using too many libraries and relying on prebuilt modules just adds bloat to the project which you could have coded better and faster yourself.",0

"I'm a Laravel developer and I found for rapid proof of concept production systems, I go with: Laravel, Laravel Livewire, Vite or Webpack, using a LEMP stack on a dedicated bare metal server from OVH (if your budget is severely limited or it's personal then Kimsufi). Gets the job done, cuts development times massively and when it's time deal with scaling, using nginx load balancing and begin splitting the most resource intensive parts of the application into microservices (only split to microservices when it's proved its potential and it becomes a viable option).",0

"Always aim for the minimum viable product, or MVP � the smallest and simplest possible unit of self-contained functionality. If you are new to this stuff, like literally just start with a plain HTML file and let the needs of your application guide everything you introduce after that. 
at first, you might only need minimal interactivity, so you plug in some vanilla JavaScript. Then you realize you want more control over the look of your page so you pull in some CSS. Eventually you�ll need a place to save things so you�ll investigate wiring up a back end with a database And API to talk to that database. You get the idea. The process is iterative, adding only as much as you need to accomplish the goal, and nothing more. As your project grows in size, scale and complexity, yes � libraries and frameworks will be a necessity, but don�t think you have to jump straight into the deep end. Start small",0

"Overengineering is amazing:

I'm working on a site rn and it's the most overengineered thing ever (I got bored)
The backend is written in TypeScript, CoffeeScript and LiveScript with a syntax extension library I made myself to it faster to use
The backend code is then transpiled into JavaScript by a program written in Rust that'll run through the entire project directory, find each of these files and transpile them
The frontend is going to be written in jQuery and VueJS (only some pages actually have to exchange data so I don't have to use a single framework and I just prefer Vue for some things and jQuery for others), it'll probably just use Vanilla JavaScript.
The CMS'll front end will probably be just jQuery with vanilla JavaScript for the GUI and the backend for the CMS (the code that'll be used to change whatever the user changes about the website) will be written in either Crystal (because the language is simple and I just enjoy using it) or C++ (because I just have more knowledge of how to use C++ than Crystal).

best part is, nobody cares what I use for the website as long as it works and I'm literally bored out of my mind and know way too many random stuff for my mental health's sake, so I'll just dump it all together and send it, idec anymore, if it works, it works, and I won't get bored having to write everything in JavaScript, because tbh JS sucks",0

"This ONLY applies if you work alone and don't care for data loss.

GIT is NOT optional. Not even as a solo dev.
As soon as the project includes two or more devs you need a unified code style and something that enforces that, a simple CI pipeline is the way to go. Just add one script and your GIT solution will take care of the rest. Unless you use gitea or something similar, your git solution will always come with sopme sort of CI/CD.

If you are building a app for a bigger company where bugs cost real money, unit tests are also not optional anymore. Direct deployment is a cardinal sin here, which should be punished by death.

Yes, if you build a small web page for your grand ma petite fire is ok, for anything else: Hire an architect and let him do his job. If you work for a big company with multiple devs and have no architct, you are doing it wrong and building an app that WILL fail soon. There is no way around that.

"Actually there are tailwind libraries such as Daisy ui which has a bunch of components.
Rly like that library ?",0
"So Tailwind is just moving out a lot of CSS code into your JS code? Why not use inline style then?

Edit : actually you just end up with double of the code amount as every class used in js also exist on CSS",0
"great content! thanks, by the way, is Tailwind CSS suitable for a medium to big size project?",0
"Imho the best way to use tailwind is to inspect the css output of your 20 class monstruosity, and refactor the most common combinations into custom vanilla CSS classes when you are done with the design. Or combining it with a preexisting library of classes that already basically do this like DaisyUI.

Then you end up with classes that are pretty close to a combination of Tailwind classes, and you can still use tailwind with dead code elimination for tweaks to individual elements that should be different. But don't use the same 20-class monstruosity 20 times in your HTML imho",0
"1:16 ah yes, the lovely **boostrap**",0
"Still not sold sadly. Seems like just another way to do CSS and yet another syntax we have to learn. And re-writting the same lines of code over and over and over.  Don't get me wrong there are pros, and for one off projects with little design guidance its great. But also a nightmare for any project with fluid design standards. 

Example : 
Which is better? 
<a href=""#"" className=""hover:bg-violet-600 active:bg-violet-600 focus:bg-violet-600 ""> Link </a> 
or 
.default-link {
    &:hover, &:focus, &:active { background-color: var(--bg-violet-600) } 
}

But WAY better than bootstrap. I am so tired of bootstrap. And I can change an entire color scheme from one location. root.",0

With all the above info, my question starts here sir, let's have an array. we will apply the binary search to search an array element, before binary search we need bubble sorting because binary search work on sorting. worst case and good are equal linear. Question  Can we say linear search === binary search? _x000D_
bubble sort O(n2)  + binary O(log N) ) / 2 = linear O(n)?",0
Never mind I assume figured now you keep saying we need an approximation,0

[10,20,30,0,0]
Put a breakpoint in main at the numbers.print() call and inspect the variable.
Also, removeAt doesn't remove anything, it simply changes the index and leaves the array at the same size. I normally would mention this but you are telling us that it does remove it and that the array is dynamic.

"very useful course , thanks!

My only wish, is that you probably should try to avoid making changes to code, when you are talking about concepts or draw attention to animation.
It tripped me over several times , when I missed you adding small, but important changes to code, while I was listening to explanation of ideas and technics, or looked at the animation speed on a rendered part of the screen, because you were talking about them etc. 
I think it is better to split talking and changing code, or do it in a more obvious manner, otherwise it is difficult to concentrate on your words, if I have to watch your cursor closely in the same time.
Still great content :)",1
"Absolutely amazing content!!!!! Thank you so much for the gigantic efforts that went into making this awesome tutorial!!!!!

My humble contribution, if i may: in the completed final project you can still see a small wobble in the background: it's subtle, but by adding some space in-between the 2 images that are drawn one after the other when the draw() method of the Layer class gets called, you'll notice that it occurs when the x position of either image is reset to 0 by the update() method. I fixed this by creating a new property for the Layer class called x2 with an initial value of 1667 (or simply put, this.width) and modifying the update() and draw() method of the Layer class like this:

update() {_x000D_
        if (this.x < -this.width) this.x = this.width - this.game.speed * this.speedModifier + this.x2;_x000D_
        else this.x -= this.game.speed * this.speedModifier;_x000D_
        if (this.x2 < -this.width) this.x2 = this.width - this.game.speed * this.speedModifier + this.x;_x000D_
        else this.x2 -= this.game.speed * this.speedModifier;_x000D_
    }_x000D_
    draw(context) {_x000D_
        context.drawImage(this.image, this.x, this.y, this.width, this.height);_x000D_
        context.drawImage(this.image, this.x2, this.y, this.width, this.height);_x000D_
    }

This way, the x position of both images is only reset when the image is already off-screen, and the new images are also drawn off-screen.

"15:53 FLASH WARNING ?? 
Not just at this specific point, but on some occasions too shortly after, as we are dealing with animating from a spritesheet, and how to not include blank frames in the animation shown. The animation is displayed at very fast speed and the subject is black, so there is a high-speed flickering between black and white.
At 18:52 the animation speed has been slowed down again, so there shouldn't be a problem after that.

Just wanted to make sure this is known! Love the video so far!",0

Thank you!,0
The best video I have got on youtube for docker.,0
"Thanks for all the effort you've put on this video, Nana. It's super well made and helpful!",0
"So at 16:38, you mentioned that Docker Desktop uses the Hypervisor layer, which supports virtualization and lightweight Linux distro on Windows, so does that mean that Docker Desktop is running as a virtual Machine on Windows as it requires a separate Linux kernel to support docker?",0
"Thanks for this, such a fantastic guide. I got through the steps of downloading my image just fine but when I tried to run the image, my terminal did not output anything. Is that a problem with the image itself?",0
,0
"Nana, thank you so much for this awesome video. You have made it so easy to understand especially for some one who has no knowledge of what a container is. Loving your content on youtube.",0

"Thanks for your Golang tutorial for beginners. With ur tutorial,I was able to start building project around Golang language",0
"Shouldn't it be CMD [""node"",""src/server.js""]?",0
Nana you have explained docker perfectly. Your explanations and animation graphics make it so much easy to understand. Before watching this video I have zero knowledge about docker  but right now I feel like I have more than beginner knowledge about docker just because of your explanations style. Do keep up the good work and take love.,0
"Outstanding video, very clear and well-paced.",0
Very well explained and video is of absolute clear quality. Your way of teaching is so good and keep rocking always..??,0
"Really enjoying this and finding it useful. One part that I think needs a bit more clarity is the ""creating the Dockerfile"". I would have liked to see the process of ""how the app is integrated into a Docker image"" (even just conceptually ) much earlier in the sequence (kept on wondering about this).  
When it was finally explained - it was a bit rushed, and also the Base Image was introduced en-route, which was a bit much to take in... 
Nana et al. - Many Thanks for this!!",0
"Thanks so much NANA, for very informative videos. The way you explain very impressive.",0
"not familiar with liunx but i have QNAP Nas it have docker, can u help my to make firefox contanier or chrome to use it in GUI like windows",0

it took me three whole days to finally land on a video that makes sense. thanks for your explanations. how do you know what component of the image link in the tag represents the version? or are all of them versions?,0
Very Good Tutorial,0
thanks you are help me,0
Thanks!,0
1:05:52 How does the deployment server know that it needs to pull the mongodb image from the registry? Is that specified in the javascript application's Dockerfile?,0
Can I ask why you used node at the start of the image,0
I appreciate you so much Nana. Thank you so much.,0
very useful... thanks a lot,0
Thank you. This was very informative as someone getting into linux.,0
amazing explations i like it,0
"In your last segment, which began at about 1:03:00,. you have a developer writing JS to access MongoDB which is running from a Docker container.  In order to make sure that the new Image will work, I imagine that the dev will need to develop the JS in a ""hermetic"" environment so that no hidden dependencies are utilized.  Is this isolation from outside resources accomplished by running Node and the JS from the Docker console?",0
Where we can run all these commands or What is the application name that miss is using,0
"Checking out this video because I do not know much about docker but my friend just started learning about it at ACI. I have a background in teaching college courses and let me tell you, its not worth having a course overview on youtube videos or tell people how they will feel after it. Most people tune out during overviews so its a waste of time.",0
I loved this crash course. Thanks!,0
Thank you so much nana????,0
"It's a simple yet powerful tutorial, thanks Nana. Keep creating such amazing videos",0
Thank you so much for this video. Those docker auto generated names are pure fire though :D,0
Thank you so much for your charitable contributions Nana. The growing count of Subscribers you have speaks volumes as to the appreciation your audience has for you.,0
Amazing work and clear concepts make us learn so fun and enjoy.,0
Thanks!,0
Here i have one doubt.... This docker will increase the speed of our system rather than using resources on install ?,0
This is the most comprehensive beginner guide to Docker. Thanks a lot!,0
"16:45 I don't understand can't you also add os in docker as well cause I've did it , cant you use like a kernel image and run thing on top of it so it runs on any os specifically using FROM OS in the docker file and then you can even access its terminal",0
Awesome explanation and we are able to understand the Docker concept,0
"This tutorial is just awesome! I was struggling to build the whole Docker picture in my head, but this video just rock it! Thank you!",0
Am I the only whose node-app is not working? The container doesn't start. Am I missing the cue at 57:36?,0
"The course has been immensely helpful however after binding ports my browser doesn't show Ngnix running on it, instead it shows, ""the site can't be reached"", wondering what could be the reason?",0
"I learnt docker in just one hour. this is amazing, your presentation and explanation with examples is awesome :)",0
"So the Windows version is basically a full blown virtual machine (although a lightweight version of linux). Hmmm... I mainly use windows, I might try it out.",0
"How did you get docker tab/exe/app whatever you wanna call it, up in the chrome toolbar there after installing? That does not happen in Chrome on my machine(windows), Is it only a Mac feature? I can only run docker from desktop/taskbar/installation folder once I installed it.",0
100% ?,0
'RUN npm install' doesn't work. You need to run 'RUN npm install express',0
"Thanks, you help me alot",0
This was great!,0
Thanks!,0
"Amazing introduction to Docker, it was super clear and concise, thank you so much Nana ! ?? Going to the 3 hours full course RN",0

She's good.,0
"Absolutely wonderful video Nana, this has given me perfect fundamental understanding of Docker and its necessity. Thank you ? for helping the tech community.",0
"Can someone answer me why I got this error when I tried to create the image? I have tried to follow the all same steps in videos but I still got ""ERROR: failed to solve: failed to read dockerfile: open /var/lib/docker/tmp/buildkit-mount1845875432/Dockerfile: no such file or directory""",0

"Thank you so much for these devops series. Love from India, I really love the way u teach",0

Thank you so much! ?,0
"I'm taking a DevSecOps class that touched on Docker, but I'm 13 minutes into this video and it's already clarifying some holes in my understanding. Thanks so much... I'm really looking forward to checking out your other videos.",0
"Brilliant job of explaining this.  The examples were realistic, the graphics were clear and helpful, and the pace was just right. Thank you!",0
is there any way to access these slides?,0
Completey beginner here. Can someone explain me please how Jenkins (I asking about simplified workflow in the end of the video) will know that it should include mongo in dockerfile? Also that one docker image (that with the app) need other docker image (with mongo) and how to connect them on deployment server? This instruction should be defined by developer?,0
Super Explanation,0
This is how I learn every topic. Now I see someone who doing the same thing. Appreciate it. This is the way of teaching something.,0

Great presentation with clear and understandable slides. Can�t be done better in this timing. Thanks for sharing!,0
nice explanation and get the main idea,0
Wow great video thanks a lot subbed already,0
"Microservices aren't just smaller/more specific applications. In your diagram at 3:05 you have the API, Business logic and DB in one microservice, this is wrong. Instead, you would have a microservice for the API, one for the business logic (or multiple depending on your sub architecture - actor pattern etc) and then your DB would be another microservice, these together combine to makeup the ""product service"", ""payment service"", etc",0
please make a video on data engineering/Big data,1
Really an enjoyable content! U have a new suscriber here :),0
really enjoyed watching the video ,0

Awesome animations and explanations!!! Really it was easy to understand and got all the infos in.?,0
Thanks for this content. It is very helpful.,0
Good clear for beginner!,0
I love your channel name. SUBSCRIBED!!!!,0
"These days I feel like application per team is the default. It's quite rare to see hundreds of people work on a monolith. at least in web.

So if I hear someone now say they use microservices I imagine it's more micro than a few services per team. Like that krazam sketch. Looking up a user isn't just one service, it's one to get the name, one to get the age etc.",0
Great thanks sir ?,0
"Beautifully and simply explained, love the diagrams! Please continue to make content like this!",1
Nice one sir.... could you please explain multi tenant architecture best practices in 5 mins ... thanks (:,1

"Hello, video was beautiful but I suggest you upgrade your microphone, it's noisy.",1
Thank you for this. Very helpful!,0
"Microservices only re-arrange components, which may help to reduce IT-complexity to some extent. However, microservices don't do anything to address complexity in IT-systems driven by underlying complexity in business processes and business rules. If nothing is done about (needless?) complexity in business processes of an organization, devising IT-solutions to handle that complexity will always be something like fighting running battles at best.",0
I want to make videos for your channel,1
How did you do that animation at 2:25 ?,0
"It's a great concept buddy, attention span of people has reduced drastically, and people don't want to look at 16�18-minute videos, one more thing try to keep your thumbnails like @TheArtofImprovement those are really good for such videos and also develop a short channel where you can sum-up everything under a minute, I hope to see you progressing from 5k to million soon.",0
Excellent video. Great job.,0
"Please more videos like this, new subscriber.",0
Good explain!!!,0
Very well explained Sir. Just Keep it going please....!!!,1
"each concept have their advantages and disadvantages.. I have experience with both Monolithic & Microservices.. I prefer microservices because of below reasons

These keyboards are so annoying. Stop buying loud keyboards.,1
not my proudest f4p. nice hands dude,0
how do you see the page while programming and it keeps reloading auto?,0
Someone who is not programming in vim and still using mouse to get the work done? What a refreshing content :),0
"fake programmer.. there was no cursing, no posts on stack overflow, the code ACTUALLY WORKS.. soooo fake.",0
"I am actually writing this comment with the exact same keyboard as you, isnt this crazy ?",0
"Good video :)
One small thing, which is in line with teaching beginners: it makes sense to farm out large sections of code into smaller functions to avoid creating one function which is long as War and Peace.
like the hide and show section in case of a 404. It would not change the coding logic (as in it does not introduce anything complex) but allows the code to be separated and introduces code re-usability without actually calling attention to it thus scarring people away.
Also the switch could be simply a function which would return the string of 'images/filename.png' so you would have only one image.src set

(please note: i am not criticising your work, this is just something i believe is important from the very early stages to keep the functions short and teaches beginners of the importance of structuring, naming conventions and context separation - rather than letting them running into ""bugs"" which is most often solved through pushing variables into the global space )

However feel free to ignore it ::) its your channel, its your work and I appreciate the work you put in this

Besides that its a great video and channel :)",0

"Around a month ago I started my frontend journey. I started with HTML and CSS, I was building templates from figma and other. After 2-2.5 weeks I startes to learn JS. All this time I was doing these courses from FreeCodeCamp, ""30 days with JS"" and other. Also I did few projects by myself (Battleship, Tic Tac Toe, BlackJack, Memory and something more). I'm reading books like ""You Don't Know JS"" series and other, but I don't think that reading books is good enough because I need to apply practically new knowledge to something. Yesterday I've complete my last FreeCodeCamp block from JS course and I don't know where to go now; what to do. Is there a proper way to learn frontend for free by yourself?",0

"Hello! I am an hour in and i absolute love it, last year i started to learn Swift App development through - CredoAcadamy by Robert Petras. I built couple apps through that but it was very ''copy and paste'' style learning so i dont really feel like i learned much from that. My dream has always been being an iOS developer since i first got my hands on an iPhone 3G back in 2008. As a huge procrastinator i kept telling myself that its not possible for me to learn it by myself and i have to do Uni. Now well im 29 years old and that dream has not gone anywhere, so that means its now or never. So my question would be, is this video good to start in 2023, or should i fully focus on SwiftUI? Or everything i learn here will be beneficial to me anyways? 

Sorry for the long paragraph and hope to hear from you soon!

For reference to what part of the video I am exactly referring to the time stamp is 7:50:30.",0
"I started this last week, or maybe the week before. Everything was going well until I got to the Colors App. I even wrote the FIZZBUZZ code on my own! Where I have started struggling is when you do something in Storyboard, I struggle to find it on my side, it takes forever or I simply can't. I'm using Xcode 14.2 on MacOS Ventura 13.2.1. Sometimes it doesn't act the same and I can't figure out why, which gets frustrating. For example, adding the table view to the Colors View Controller, Xcode didn't offer a way that I could find to NOT conform to the Safe Area. I spent 45 minutes trying to find the setting to allow it to go all the way to the bottom of the live preview. I could drag it down by its center handle when selected but then it displayed a negative number and displayed warnings. Also, my Navigation Bar isn't even visible and I spent at least a half hour trying to make it visible to no avail. At this point, I'm not sure how to proceed because if I can't get through this, how do I get through the rest of these videos? What does that say about me as a potential developer? Please know I am not complaining about you or your content, because I like your style,  and appreciate what you're doing. Any advice you or anyone seeing this can offer is greatly appreciated.",0

Not great.

So I'm still interested, but not sure the content in this video is as current as it needs to be.

Last... Xcode isn't exactly getting great reviews currently - from the App Store, it looks like it's pretty broken.

"I absolutely loved the Swift Closures Explained video by Sean Allen. As someone who has struggled to understand closures, this video was a godsend. Sean does an amazing job of breaking down the confusing aspects of closures, like what the parenthesis mean and the shorthand syntax. He explains everything in a clear and concise manner, making it easy for even a beginner like myself to follow along.

I also appreciate the fact that Sean provides a promo code for Squarespace at the beginning of the video. It�s always great to get a discount when you�re starting a new website or domain.

Overall, I highly recommend this video to anyone who is struggling to understand closures, or anyone who wants to brush up on their Swift knowledge. Thank you, Sean, for creating such an informative and helpful video.",0

This video really explained well how SwiftUI are just bunch of shorthand ways of writing trailing closures. Could you explain the following code for me? I know what it does, but how did this shorthand version got formed? What would it's ""full hand"" counterpart be?

Most easiest concept in swift is closure,0
Hi Sean are closures like object in java where you can call them whenever you need them,0
"What a wonderful tutorial, clear but also full of knowledge. You really helped me understand the book of swiftUI, thanks a lot !",0

"Hey Sean, thanks for this. Can you make a video about Callbacks? Differences between completion handlers and Callbacks?",1
"Suggestion: When teaching to beginners, use unique variable names throughout your code and try not to repeat them between functions that don't end up passing the variable out of it anyways� @6:25 you talk about how we could have used 'persons' instead of 'student' but are using 'student' because it ""makes more sense, they're students""� but I see the name 'student' being used at least 13 times on that one screen alone. As stupid as it sounds when I'm learning the new syntaxes I type in variable names like ""sparkleUnicorn"" and ""bubaTheBillyGoat"" (silly name placeholders) to keep track of where the variables actually point and go to. When the tutorial overloads with one word being re-used over and over again it just makes my head spin.",1

"RESTful concept is great in an ideal world. In a real world it contradicts with Web Security requirements. Use of a GET method is limited, because no sensitive data can be exposed as a part of REST URI. When I want to read something and REST suggests to use a GET call, but I want to hide read parameters from a man-in-the-middle, I must use POST or PUT to pass all sensitive data in a body.",0

"API is a way for computers to talk to each other. 

REST is a common standard to build web based APIs.

The API resources are identified by nouns rather than verbs.

The HTTP methods are verbs for actions to the resource.
